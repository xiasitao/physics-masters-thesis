# Corrections

## Intro
- compact design
- fast cycle time

- necessity of cooling -> transition to my thesis

## FermiQP
### 
- Paschen-Back regime
    - electronic splitting 2GHz
    - nuclear 80 MHz -> Lithium good as the small hyperfine splitting enables parallelity of the 1 and 2 states
- Feshbach resonance at 832 G

### Setup
- 2D MOT for fast cycle time
- 1 paragraph about setup of the lab from the beginning
- pictures (empty lab, table moving, chamber, whole lab)

## Coils
- Put measurements to the back
    - 1 section for ideal coils
    - 1 section for measurements
