# Quantum gas microscopy

- find sources and draw timeline
- find current sources and find state of the art


# MOT

- MOT calculations (capture velocities depending on fields etc.)


# Experiment setup

- polarisation
    - find waveplate settings for reaching left/right light "at atoms" using the cube method, note down
    - remove mirror and measure the polarizations
- finish coupling
- laser setup power measurements
