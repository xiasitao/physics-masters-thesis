# Quantum gas microscopy

- find sources and draw timeline
- find current sources and find state of the art


# MOT

- MOT calculations (capture velocities depending on fields etc.)


# Experiment setup

- polarisation
    - find out sqrt(WPs) such that we can fix the polarisation hitting the reflection mirror
- finish coupling
- laser setup power measurements
