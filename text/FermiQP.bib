This leads to much higher atomic densities as repulsive forces between atoms due to rescattered radiation are reduced and trap loss due to excited-state collisions is diminished. In such a trap, more than 1010 sodium atoms have been confined to densities approaching 1012 atoms cm−3.},

The essential tool of our experimental setup is a pair of identical, high-resolution microscope objectives. One of the microscope objectives allows local imaging of the trapped Fermi gas of 6Li atoms with a maximum resolution of 660 nm, while the other enables the generation of arbitrary optical dipole potentials on the same length scale. Employing a two-dimensional (2D) acousto-optical deflector, we demonstrate the formation of several trapping geometries, including a tightly focused single optical dipole trap, a 4×4 site 2D optical lattice and an 8 site ring lattice configuration. Furthermore, we show the ability to load and detect a small number of atoms in these trapping potentials. A site separation down to one micrometer in combination with the low mass of 6Li results in tunneling rates that are sufficiently large for the implementation of Hubbard models with the designed geometries.},

Laser cooling of lithium is usually performed on the 2S1/2→2P3/2 (D2) transition, and temperatures of ∼300 μK are typically achieved. The linewidth of the uv transition is seven times narrower than the D2 line, resulting in lower laser cooling temperatures. We demonstrate that a {MOT} operating on the uv transition reaches temperatures as low as 59 μK. Furthermore, we find that the light shift of the uv transition in an optical dipole trap at 1070 nm is small and blueshifted, facilitating efficient loading from the uv {MOT}. Evaporative cooling of a two spin-state mixture of 6Li in the optical trap produces a quantum degenerate Fermi gas with 3×106 atoms in a total cycle time of only 11 s.},

The maximum recapture rate of ∼109 s−1 is obtained for T≈700 K and results in a total of up to 1010 trapped atoms. The recaptured fraction is estimated to be 30±10\% and limited by beam divergence. The most-probable velocity in the beam (αz) is varied from 18 to 70 m/s by increasing the intensity of a push beam. The source is quite monochromatic with a full width at half maximum velocity spread of 11 m/s at αz=36 m/s, demonstrating that side loading completely eliminates beam contamination by hot vapor from the oven. We identify depletion of the low-velocity tail of the oven flux as the limiting loss mechanism. Our approach is suitable for other atomic species.},

The square lattice is created by a folded retro-reflected beam configuration that can reach 2.5{\textasciitilde}{mK} lattice depth from a single laser source. The lattice beam is elliptically focused to have a large area with deep potential. On average 4,000 photons are collected per atom during 1{\textasciitilde}s of the Raman sideband cooling, and the imaging fidelity is over 95\${\textbackslash}\%\$ in the central 80\${\textbackslash}times\$80 lattice sites. As a first step to study correlated quantum phases, we present the site-resolved imaging of a Mott insulator.

We investigate the influence of the detuning between the the two cooling frequencies and observe a threefold decrease of the temperature when the Raman condition is fulfilled. We interpret this effect as arising from extra cooling due to long-lived coherences between hyperfine states. Solving the optical Bloch equations for a simplified, {\textbackslash}Lambda-type three-level system we identify the presence of an efficient cooling force near the Raman condition. After transfer into a quadrupole magnetic trap, we measure a phase space density of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}-5. This laser cooling offers a promising route for fast evaporation of lithium atoms to quantum degeneracy in optical or magnetic traps.},

Yet, the intricate nature of Fermi systems poses a barrier to answering important questions concerning dwave superconductivity and quantum magnetism. Recently, it has become possible to experimentally realize the Fermi-Hubbard model using a fermionic quantum gas loaded into an optical lattice. In this atomic approach to the Fermi-Hubbard model, the Hamiltonian is a direct result of the optical lattice potential created by interfering laser fields and short-ranged ultracold collisions. It provides a route to simulate the physics of the Hamiltonian and to address open questions and novel challenges of the underlying many-body system. This review gives an overview of the current efforts in understanding and realizing experiments with fermionic atoms in optical lattices and discusses key experiments in the metallic, band-insulating, superfluid, and Mott-insulating regimes.},

modern physics. Ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices have shown to be a
versatile tool in these studies of many-body effects. This thesis reports the
setup of a dual species magneto-optical trap of 6Li and 7Li as the first cool-
ing stage of a new experiment towards single-site resolved fermions in an
optical lattices.
A decreasing Zeeman slower and a 3D magneto-optical trap are used to
slow and trap an atomic beam from a lithium oven. The laser power is
provided by a setup with four lasers at 671 nm. We achieve frequency
stabilization by a standard Doppler-free spectroscopy technique with one
master laser, which serves via offset-locks as a reference for all other lasers.
Amplification with two tapered amplifiers and the overlapping of all four
frequencies before the single mode fibers allow for a minimum of optics
next to the main vacuum chamber.
The {MOT} and the Zeeman slower are thoroughly experimentally character-
ized and the results are compared to theoretical models. We observe that
the number of trapped atoms and their lifetime in the trap are limited by
homonuclear inelastic collisions. Almost no interaction between the two
isotopes is recorded due to a difference in atom number and density. The
density distribution of the atoms in the trap clearly shows a core of con-
stant density, which is limited by radiation trapping.
We use a compressed phase after the loading of the trap with decreased
detunings and laser intensities to cool the atoms towards the Doppler limit.
The resulting sample of 3 · 109 atoms at 500 μK is subsequently loaded
into a magnetic trap for further cooling by evaporation.},

Common methods include time-of-flight measurements to access the momentum distribution of the gas, the use of cavities to monitor global properties of the quantum gas with minimal disturbance, and phase-contrast or high-intensity absorption imaging to obtain local real-space information in high-density settings. Even the ultimate limit of detecting each and every atom locally has been realized in two dimensions using so-called quantum gas microscopes. In fact, these microscopes have not only revolutionized detection—they have also revolutionized the control of lattice gases. Here, we provide a short overview of quantum gas microscopy, highlighting the new observables it can access as well as key experiments that have been enabled by its development.},

We observe a coherent entangling–disentangling evolution in the many-body system, depending on the phase shift acquired during the collision between neighbouring atoms.

Atoms in an optical lattice in the Mott insulator regime serve as a large qubit register. A spin-dependent lattice is used to split and delocalize the atomic wave functions in a controlled and coherent way over a defined number of lattice sites. This is used to experimentally demonstrate a massively parallel quantum gate array, which allows the creation of a highly entangled many-body cluster state through coherent collisions between atoms on neighbouring lattice sites. In magnetic microtraps on an atom chip, we demonstrate coherent manipulation of atomic qubit states and measure coherence lifetimes exceeding one second at micron-distance from the chip surface. We show that microwave near-fields on the chip can be used to create state-dependent potentials for the implementation of a quantum controlled phase gate with these robust qubit states. For single atom detection and preparation, we have developed high finesse fiber Fabry-Perot cavities and integrated them on the ato m chip. We present an experiment in which we detected a very small number of cold atoms magnetically trapped in the cavity using the atom chip.},

In contrast, we propose an architecture which allows for the merger of a selected qubit pair in a long-periodicity superlattice structure consisting of two optical lattices with close-lying periodicity. We numerically optimize the gate time and fidelity, including the effects on neighboring atoms and in the presence of experimental sources of error. Furthermore, the superlattice architecture induces a differential hyperfine shift, allowing for single-qubit gates. The fastest possible single-qubit gate times, given a maximal tolerable rotation error on the remaining atoms at various values of the lattice wavelengths, are identified. We find that robust single- and two-qubit gates with gate times of a few hundred microseconds and with error probabilities ∼10−3 are possible.},

Specifically, we realize the controlled-phase gate, enacted by a novel, fast protocol involving only global coupling of two qubits to Rydberg states. We benchmark this operation by preparing Bell states with fidelity F≥95.0(2)\%, and extract gate fidelity ≥97.4(3)\%, averaged across five atom pairs. In addition, we report a proof-of-principle implementation of the three-qubit Toffoli gate, in which two control atoms simultaneously constrain the behavior of one target atom.

One of the major bottlenecks of this platform is the weak coupling strength between adjacent atoms, which limits the speed of two-qubit gates. Here, we present a method to perform a fast universal √{SWAP} gate with fermionic atoms that interact through a short-range potential. The basic idea of the gate is to release the atoms into a harmonic potential positioned in between the two atoms. By properly tailoring the interaction parameter, the collision process between the atoms generates entanglement and yields the desired gate. We prove analytically that in the limit of broad atomic wave packets, the fidelity of the gate approaches unity. We demonstrate numerically that with typical experimental parameters, our gate can operate on a microsecond timescale and achieves a fidelity higher than 0.998. Moreover, the gate duration is independent of the initial distance between the atoms. A gate with such features is an important milestone towards all-to-all connectivity and fault tolerance in quantum computation with neutral atoms.},

	abstract = {Controllable, coherent many-body systems can provide insights into the fundamental properties of quantum matter, enable the realization of new quantum phases and could ultimately lead to computational systems that outperform existing computers based on classical approaches. Here we demonstrate a method for creating controlled many-body quantum matter that combines deterministically prepared, reconfigurable arrays of individually trapped cold atoms with strong, coherent interactions enabled by excitation to Rydberg states. We realize a programmable Ising-type quantum spin model with tunable interactions and system sizes of up to 51 qubits. Within this model, we observe phase transitions into spatially ordered states that break various discrete symmetries, verify the high-fidelity preparation of these states and investigate the dynamics across the phase transition in large arrays of atoms. In particular, we observe robust many-body dynamics corresponding to persistent oscillations of the order after a rapid quantum quench that results from a sudden transition across the phase boundary. Our method provides a way of exploring many-body phenomena on a programmable quantum simulator and could enable realizations of new quantum algorithms.},

The dynamics of the transition from a band insulator to a normal state is studied, and the time scale is measured to be an order of magnitude larger than the tunneling time in the lattice. Using a Feshbach resonance, we increase the interaction between atoms in two different spin states and dynamically induce a coupling between the lowest energy bands. We observe a shift of this coupling with respect to the Feshbach resonance in free space which is anticipated for strongly confined atoms.},

These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose–Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.},

In this quest, the Hubbard model has emerged as a conceptually simple, yet rich model describing such physics. Here we present an experimental determination of the equation of state of the repulsive two-dimensional Hubbard model over a broad range of interactions 0≲U/t≲20 and temperatures, down to {kBT}/t=0.63(2) using high-resolution imaging of ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices. We show density profiles, compressibilities, and double occupancies over the whole doping range, and, hence, our results constitute benchmarks for state-of-the-art theoretical approaches.},

The plane to be imaged is isolated using microwave spectroscopy in a magnetic-field gradient, and can be chosen at any depth within the three-dimensional lattice. With a similar protocol, we also demonstrate patterned selection within a single lattice plane. High-resolution images are acquired using a microscope objective with 0.8 numerical aperture, from which we determine the occupation of lattice sites in the imaging plane with 94(2)\% fidelity per atom. Imaging with single-atom sensitivity and addressing with single-site accuracy are key steps towards the search for unconventional superfluidity of fermions in optical lattices, the initialization and characterization of transport and nonequilibrium dynamics, and the observation of magnetic domains.},

For this, a massive number of parallel entangled atom pairs have been realized in superlattices. However, the more formidable challenge is to scale-up and detect multipartite entanglement due to the lack of manipulations over local atomic spins in retro-reflected bichromatic superlattices. Here we developed a new architecture based on a cross-angle spin-dependent superlattice for implementing layers of quantum gates over moderately-separated atoms incorporated with a quantum gas microscope for single-atom manipulation. We created and verified functional building blocks for scalable multipartite entanglement by connecting Bell pairs to one-dimensional 10-atom chains and two-dimensional plaquettes of \$2{\textbackslash}times4\$ atoms. This offers a new platform towards scalable quantum computation and simulation.},

	abstract = {Quantum control of motion is central for modern atomic clocks1 and interferometers2. It enables protocols to process and distribute quantum information3,4, and allows the probing of entanglement in correlated states of matter5. However, the motional coherence of individual particles can be fragile to maintain, as external degrees of freedom couple strongly to the environment. Systems in nature with robust motional coherence instead often involve pairs of particles, from the electrons in helium, to atom pairs6, molecules7 and Cooper pairs. Here we demonstrate long-lived motional coherence and entanglement of pairs of fermionic atoms in an optical lattice array. The common and relative motion of each pair realize a robust qubit, protected by exchange symmetry. The energy difference between the two motional states is set by the atomic recoil energy, is dependent on only the mass and the lattice wavelength, and is insensitive to the noise of the confining potential. We observe quantum coherence beyond ten seconds. Modulation of the interactions between the atoms provides universal control of the motional qubit. The methods presented here will enable coherently programmable quantum simulators of many-fermion systems8, precision metrology based on atom pairs and molecules9,10 and, by implementing further advances11–13, digital quantum computation using fermion pairs14.},

While other systems have shown impressive coherence times through some combination of shielding, careful trapping, global operations, and dynamical decoupling, we achieve comparable coherence times while individually driving multiple qubits in parallel. We highlight that even with simultaneous manipulation of multiple qubits within the register, we observe coherence in excess of 105 times the current length of the operations, with \$\$\{T\}\_\{2\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{\{\{\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{echo\}\}\}\}\}\}={\textbackslash}left(40{\textbackslash}pm 7{\textbackslash}right)\$\$seconds.

	abstract = {After many years of development of the basic tools, quantum simulation with ultracold atoms has now reached the level of maturity at which it can be used to investigate complex quantum processes. Planning of new experiments and upgrading of existing set-ups requires a broad overview of the available techniques, their specific advantages and limitations. This Technical Review aims to provide a comprehensive compendium of the state of the art. We discuss the basic principles, the available techniques and their current range of applications. Focusing on the simulation of various phenomena in solid-state physics through optical lattice experiments, we review their basics, the necessary techniques and the accessible physical parameters. We outline how to control and use interactions with external potentials and interactions between the atoms, and how to design new synthetic gauge fields and spin–orbit coupling. We discuss the latest progress in site-resolved techniques that use quantum gas microscopes, and describe the unique features of quantum simulation experiments with two-electron atomic species.},
