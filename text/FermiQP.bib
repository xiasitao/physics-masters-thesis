First we describe experiments in which the atomic distributions obtained by loading Bose–Einstein condensates of rubidium atoms in the lattice are dynamically split by transforming a 2D lattice with period λ into a 2D lattice with period λ/2, and we show how this procedure allows for the study of the coherence and interaction properties of the system. Then we show how we can efficiently adiabatically transfer the population between adjacent sites of the lattice, as well as between different energy bands, by using dynamic modifications of the potential.},

Here we introduce a qubit encoded in two nuclear spin states of a single 87Sr atom and demonstrate coherence approaching the minute-scale within an assembled register of individually-controlled qubits. While other systems have shown impressive coherence times through some combination of shielding, careful trapping, global operations, and dynamical decoupling, we achieve comparable coherence times while individually driving multiple qubits in parallel. We highlight that even with simultaneous manipulation of multiple qubits within the register, we observe coherence in excess of 105 times the current length of the operations, with \$\$\{T\}\_\{2\}\^\{\{\{\{\{\textbackslash mathrm\{echo\}\}\}\}\}\}=\textbackslash left(40\textbackslash pm 7\textbackslash right)\$\$seconds.

We realize a programmable Ising-type quantum spin model with tunable interactions and system sizes of up to 51 qubits. Within this model, we observe phase transitions into spatially ordered states that break various discrete symmetries, verify the high-fidelity preparation of these states and investigate the dynamics across the phase transition in large arrays of atoms. In particular, we observe robust many-body dynamics corresponding to persistent oscillations of the order after a rapid quantum quench that results from a sudden transition across the phase boundary. Our method provides a way of exploring many-body phenomena on a programmable quantum simulator and could enable realizations of new quantum algorithms.},

We combine 3D Raman sideband cooling with high-resolution optics to simultaneously cool and image individual atoms with single-lattice-site resolution at a detection fidelity above 95\%. The imaging process leaves the atoms predominantly in the 3D motional ground state of their respective lattice sites, inviting the implementation of a Maxwell’s demon to assemble low-entropy many-body states. Single-site-resolved imaging of fermions enables the direct observation of magnetic order, time-resolved measurements of the spread of particle correlations, and the detection of many-fermion entanglement.},

Laser cooling of lithium is usually performed on the 2S1/2→2P3/2 (D2) transition, and temperatures of ∼300 μK are typically achieved. The linewidth of the uv transition is seven times narrower than the D2 line, resulting in lower laser cooling temperatures. We demonstrate that a MOT operating on the uv transition reaches temperatures as low as 59 μK. Furthermore, we find that the light shift of the uv transition in an optical dipole trap at 1070 nm is small and blueshifted, facilitating efficient loading from the uv MOT. Evaporative cooling of a two spin-state mixture of 6Li in the optical trap produces a quantum degenerate Fermi gas with 3×106 atoms in a total cycle time of only 11 s.},

The plane to be imaged is isolated using microwave spectroscopy in a magnetic-field gradient, and can be chosen at any depth within the three-dimensional lattice. With a similar protocol, we also demonstrate patterned selection within a single lattice plane. High-resolution images are acquired using a microscope objective with 0.8 numerical aperture, from which we determine the occupation of lattice sites in the imaging plane with 94(2)\% fidelity per atom. Imaging with single-atom sensitivity and addressing with single-site accuracy are key steps towards the search for unconventional superfluidity of fermions in optical lattices, the initialization and characterization of transport and nonequilibrium dynamics, and the observation of magnetic domains.},

Yet, the intricate nature of Fermi systems poses a barrier to answering important questions concerning dwave superconductivity and quantum magnetism. Recently, it has become possible to experimentally realize the Fermi-Hubbard model using a fermionic quantum gas loaded into an optical lattice. In this atomic approach to the Fermi-Hubbard model, the Hamiltonian is a direct result of the optical lattice potential created by interfering laser fields and short-ranged ultracold collisions. It provides a route to simulate the physics of the Hamiltonian and to address open questions and novel challenges of the underlying many-body system. This review gives an overview of the current efforts in understanding and realizing experiments with fermionic atoms in optical lattices and discusses key experiments in the metallic, band-insulating, superfluid, and Mott-insulating regimes.},

  abstract = {Simulating quantum mechanics is known to be a difficult computational problem, especially when dealing with large systems. However, this difficulty may be overcome by using some controllable quantum system to study another less controllable or accessible quantum system, i.e., quantum simulation. Quantum simulation promises to have applications in the study of many problems in, e.g., condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, atomic physics, quantum chemistry, and cosmology. Quantum simulation could be implemented using quantum computers, but also with simpler, analog devices that would require less control, and therefore, would be easier to construct. A number of quantum systems such as neutral atoms, ions, polar molecules, electrons in semiconductors, superconducting circuits, nuclear spins, and photons have been proposed as quantum simulators. This review outlines the main theoretical and experimental aspects of quantum simulation and emphasizes some of the challenges and promises of this fast-growing field.},

As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.},

Lett. 100, 63001 (2012)], we introduce a similar technique for 7Li atoms and obtain temperatures of 60μK while capturing all of the 5×108 atoms present from the previous stage. We investigate the influence of the detuning between the the two cooling frequencies and observe a threefold decrease of the temperature when the Raman condition is fulfilled. We interpret this effect as arising from extra cooling due to long-lived coherences between hyperfine states. Solving the optical Bloch equations for a simplified Λ-type three-level system we identify the presence of an efficient cooling force near the Raman condition. After transfer into a quadrupole magnetic trap, we measure a phase space density of ∼10−5. This laser cooling offers a promising route for fast evaporation of lithium atoms to quantum degeneracy in optical or magnetic traps.},

As they are based on atom–light interactions, the whole quantum optics toolbox can be used to tailor the detection process to the specific scientific question to be explored in the experiment. Common methods include time-of-flight measurements to access the momentum distribution of the gas, the use of cavities to monitor global properties of the quantum gas with minimal disturbance, and phase-contrast or high-intensity absorption imaging to obtain local real-space information in high-density settings. Even the ultimate limit of detecting each and every atom locally has been realized in two dimensions using so-called quantum gas microscopes. In fact, these microscopes have not only revolutionized detection—they have also revolutionized the control of lattice gases. Here, we provide a short overview of quantum gas microscopy, highlighting the new observables it can access as well as key experiments that have been enabled by its development.},

Via a combination of Sisyphus cooling followed by adiabatic expansion, we reach temperatures as low as 40 μK, which corresponds to atomic velocities a factor of 2.6 above the limit imposed by a single-photon recoil. Our method requires modest laser power at a frequency within reach of standard frequency-locking methods. It is largely insensitive to laser power, polarization and detuning, magnetic fields, and initial hyperfine populations. Our results suggest that optical molasses should be possible with all alkali-metal species.},

It enables protocols to process and distribute quantum information3,4, and allows the probing of entanglement in correlated states of matter5. However, the motional coherence of individual particles can be fragile to maintain, as external degrees of freedom couple strongly to the environment. Systems in nature with robust motional coherence instead often involve pairs of particles, from the electrons in helium, to atom pairs6, molecules7 and Cooper pairs. Here we demonstrate long-lived motional coherence and entanglement of pairs of fermionic atoms in an optical lattice array. The common and relative motion of each pair realize a robust qubit, protected by exchange symmetry. The energy difference between the two motional states is set by the atomic recoil energy, is dependent on only the mass and the lattice wavelength, and is insensitive to the noise of the confining potential. We observe quantum coherence beyond ten seconds. Modulation of the interactions between the atoms provides universal control of the motional qubit. The methods presented here will enable coherently programmable quantum simulators of many-fermion systems8, precision metrology based on atom pairs and molecules9,10 and, by implementing further advances11–13, digital quantum computation using fermion pairs14.},

  abstract = {Understanding strong-correlation in quantum systems is a central goal of modern physics. Ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices have shown to be a versatile tool in these studies of many-body effects. This thesis reports the setup of a dual species magneto-optical trap of 6Li and 7Li as the first cool- ing stage of a new experiment towards single-site resolved fermions in an optical lattices. A decreasing Zeeman slower and a 3D magneto-optical trap are used to slow and trap an atomic beam from a lithium oven. The laser power is provided by a setup with four lasers at 671 nm. We achieve frequency stabilization by a standard Doppler-free spectroscopy technique with one master laser, which serves via offset-locks as a reference for all other lasers. Amplification with two tapered amplifiers and the overlapping of all four frequencies before the single mode fibers allow for a minimum of optics next to the main vacuum chamber. The MOT and the Zeeman slower are thoroughly experimentally character- ized and the results are compared to theoretical models. We observe that the number of trapped atoms and their lifetime in the trap are limited by homonuclear inelastic collisions. Almost no interaction between the two isotopes is recorded due to a difference in atom number and density. The density distribution of the atoms in the trap clearly shows a core of con- stant density, which is limited by radiation trapping. We use a compressed phase after the loading of the trap with decreased detunings and laser intensities to cool the atoms towards the Doppler limit. The resulting sample of 3 · 109 atoms at 500 μK is subsequently loaded into a magnetic trap for further cooling by evaporation.},

Our optimal strategy does not rely on the atoms populating the lowest eigenstates of the merged potential, and it crucially includes the accumulation of quantum phases before the potentials are fully merged. Our analyses transcend the particular trapping geometry, but for comparison with previous works, we present systematic results for an optical lattice and find greatly improved gate durations and fidelities.},

In contrast, we propose an architecture which allows for the merger of a selected qubit pair in a long-periodicity superlattice structure consisting of two optical lattices with close-lying periodicity. We numerically optimize the gate time and fidelity, including the effects on neighboring atoms and in the presence of experimental sources of error. Furthermore, the superlattice architecture induces a differential hyperfine shift, allowing for single-qubit gates. The fastest possible single-qubit gate times, given a maximal tolerable rotation error on the remaining atoms at various values of the lattice wavelengths, are identified. We find that robust single- and two-qubit gates with gate times of a few hundred microseconds and with error probabilities ̃10-3 are possible.},

  abstract = {The behavior of quantum many-body systems in nature is often an issue of great  complexity. Hence, instead of describing those systems entirely, we tend to extract  particular phenomena of interest and to simulate them in accessible simplified quantum mechanical model systems.  Fortunately, the total availability of such model systems is not only restricted to  numerical models but there are many artificially prepared quantum systems. In  the field of ultracold quantum gases, experimentalists provide powerful tools for  preparing, manipulating and detecting quantum many-body systems.  A new scientific project in the group of Klaus Sengstock is setting up a modern and  versatile ultracold quantum gas experiment. It aims to prepare model systems for  simulating effects that play a role in attosecond science as well as to engineer quantum states with anyonic excitation that are e.g. relevant in studies of the fractional  quantum Hall effect.  Within the course of this first PhD thesis of the project, we built a novel apparatus  that is explicitly geared to allow quantum gas microscopy in the future as it will be  a powerful tool to analyze interesting correlations on a single particle level.  Our built apparatus includes a 2D-/3D-MOT loading scheme that we verify to work  for both stable isotopes of lithium. Due to this unconventional but compact way  of loading the atoms from a hot gas streaming out of an oven, we are able to omit  any transfer of the atoms after the trapping in a 3D-MOT. Thus, the 3D-MOT is already situated in a relatively small glass cell at the focus of an objective providing  sub-micron resolution that we characterize numerically and in a test setup to suit for  quantum gas microscopy.  As further manipulation steps, we implement gray molasses cooling that cools the  gas to sub-Doppler temperatures. It permits the loading of a far-detuned optical  dipole trap where we routinely perform all-optical evaporative cooling and reach  quantum degeneracy by realizing a Bose-Einstein condensate of weakly-bound 6Li  molecules.  As we require two-dimensional samples for our studies, we additionally implement  a red-detuned one-dimensional optical accordion for the dynamical and preferably  adiabatic squeezing of our gas within a single slice of that vertical lattice.  In order to image the atoms in that slice with single-particle resolution on a submicron level, we not only rely on an objective with high numerical aperture but also  on an additional optical lattice for pinning the atoms within the two-dimensional  plane during the emission of fluorescence photons. Here, we decided for a horizontal triangular lattice that is designed, characterized and adjusted onto the atomic  sample during the present thesis.},

We directly image the Fermi surface of the atoms in the lattice by turning off the optical lattice adiabatically. Because of the confining potential, gradual filling of the lattice transforms the system from a normal state into a band insulator. The dynamics of the transition from a band insulator to a normal state is studied, and the time scale is measured to be an order of magnitude larger than the tunneling time in the lattice. Using a Feshbach resonance, we increase the interaction between atoms in two different spin states and dynamically induce a coupling between the lowest energy bands. We observe a shift of this coupling with respect to the Feshbach resonance in free space which is anticipated for strongly confined atoms.},

The fluorescence images are obtained by implementing Raman sideband cooling on a deep two-dimensional square lattice, where we collect scattered photons with a high numerical aperture objective lens. The square lattice is created by a folded retro-reflected beam configuration that can reach 2.5\textasciitilde mK lattice depth from a single laser source. The lattice beam is elliptically focused to have a large area with deep potential. On average 4,000 photons are collected per atom during 1\textasciitilde s of the Raman sideband cooling, and the imaging fidelity is over 95\$\textbackslash\%\$ in the central 80\$\textbackslash times\$80 lattice sites. As a first step to study correlated quantum phases, we present the site-resolved imaging of a Mott insulator. Tuning the magnetic field near the Feshbach resonance, the scattering length can be increased to 680\$a\_B\$, and we are able to produce a large-sized unity filling Mott insulator with 2,000 atoms at low temperature.

The experimentally challenging production of highly entangled multi-particle states is therefore important for investigating both fundamental physics and practical applications. Here we report the creation of highly entangled states of neutral atoms trapped in the periodic potential of an optical lattice. Controlled collisions between individual neighbouring atoms are used to realize an array of quantum gates, with massively parallel operation. We observe a coherent entangling–disentangling evolution in the many-body system, depending on the phase shift acquired during the collision between neighbouring atoms. Such dynamics are indicative of highly entangled many-body states; moreover, these are formed in a single operational step, independent of the size of the system5,6.},

  abstract = {An array of ultracold neutral atoms held in optical microtraps is a promising platform for quantum computation. One of the major bottlenecks of this platform is the weak coupling strength between adjacent atoms, which limits the speed of two-qubit gates. Here, we present a method to perform a fast universal √SWAP gate with fermionic atoms that interact through a short-range potential. The basic idea of the gate is to release the atoms into a harmonic potential positioned in between the two atoms. By properly tailoring the interaction parameter, the collision process between the atoms generates entanglement and yields the desired gate. We prove analytically that in the limit of broad atomic wave packets, the fidelity of the gate approaches unity. We demonstrate numerically that with typical experimental parameters, our gate can operate on a microsecond timescale and achieves a fidelity higher than 0.998. Moreover, the gate duration is independent of the initial distance between the atoms. A gate with such features is an important milestone towards all-to-all connectivity and fault tolerance in quantum computation with neutral atoms.},

To integrate the D1 light for the gray molasses cooling into the same optical setup that is used for the D2 light for a standard magneto-optical trap (MOT), we rapidly switch the injection seeding of a slave laser between the D2 and the D1 light sources. Switching times as short as 30 μs can be achieved, inferred from monitor optical beat signals. The resulting low-intensity molasses cools a sample of N=9×108 atoms to about 60 μK. A maximum phase-space density of ρ=1.2×10−5 is observed. On the same setup, the performance of the GM is compared to that of narrow-line cooling in an ultraviolet (UV) MOT, following the procedure in Sebastian et al. [J. Sebastian, Ch. Gross, K. Li, H. C. J. Gan, W. Li, and K. Dieckmann, Phys. Rev. A 90, 033417 (2014)]. Further, we compare the production of a degenerate Fermi gas using both methods. Loading an optical dipole trap from the gray molasses yields a quantum degenerate sample with 3.3×105 atoms, while loading from the denser UV MOT yields 2.4×106 atoms. Where the highest atom numbers are not a priority this implementation of the gray molasses technique yields sufficiently large samples for a comparatively low technical effort.},

The topology of the lattice is phase stable against phase noise imparted by vibrational noise on mirrors. We demonstrate the dynamic control of the lattice by showing the coherent splitting of atoms from single wells into double wells and observing the resulting double-slit atom diffraction pattern. This lattice can be used to test controlled neutral atom motion among lattice sites and should allow for testing controlled two-qubit gates.},

The Fermion Quantum Processor (FermiQP) experiment aims to use ultracold fermionic 6Li atoms to construct a novel combined digital- and analogue quantum processor. In this thesis, a crossed-beam optical dipole trap (ODT), implemented using a 200 W, red detuned (1070 nm) laser, is proposed for use in the experiment. Trap geometries larger than the size of the focused beam are to be achieved through spatial modulation in the MHz regime using an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). The feasibility of the proposal was tested with a proof-of-concept setup built with a lower-power 1064 nm laser. A time-averaged potential with a vertical cross-sectional area approximately three times that of the static beam was attained by modulating the beam position at 3.4 MHz. By dynamically changing the shape of the time-averaged potential, the proposed ODT promises more efficient loading and faster evaporative cooling that would reduce the cycle time of the experiment as compared to a static crossed ODT.},

The maximum recapture rate of ∼109 s−1 is obtained for T≈700 K and results in a total of up to 1010 trapped atoms. The recaptured fraction is estimated to be 30±10\% and limited by beam divergence. The most-probable velocity in the beam (αz) is varied from 18 to 70 m/s by increasing the intensity of a push beam. The source is quite monochromatic with a full width at half maximum velocity spread of 11 m/s at αz=36 m/s, demonstrating that side loading completely eliminates beam contamination by hot vapor from the oven. We identify depletion of the low-velocity tail of the oven flux as the limiting loss mechanism. Our approach is suitable for other atomic species.},

  abstract = {We review our experiments on quantum information processing with neutral atoms in optical lattices and magnetic microtraps. Atoms in an optical lattice in the Mott insulator regime serve as a large qubit register. A spin-dependent lattice is used to split and delocalize the atomic wave functions in a controlled and coherent way over a defined number of lattice sites. This is used to experimentally demonstrate a massively parallel quantum gate array, which allows the creation of a highly entangled many-body cluster state through coherent collisions between atoms on neighbouring lattice sites. In magnetic microtraps on an atom chip, we demonstrate coherent manipulation of atomic qubit states and measure coherence lifetimes exceeding one second at micron-distance from the chip surface. We show that microwave near-fields on the chip can be used to create state-dependent potentials for the implementation of a quantum controlled phase gate with these robust qubit states. For single atom detection and preparation, we have developed high finesse fiber Fabry-Perot cavities and integrated them on the ato m chip. We present an experiment in which we detected a very small number of cold atoms magnetically trapped in the cavity using the atom chip.},

We demonstrate a coherent coupling between the singlet and triplet states and show how the superlattice can be employed to measure the singlet-fraction employing a spin-blockade effect. Our method provides a reliable way to detect and control nearest-neighbor spin correlations in many-body systems of ultracold atoms. Being able to measure these correlations is an important ingredient in studying quantum magnetism in optical lattices. We furthermore employ a SWAP operation between atoms which are part of different triplets, thus effectively increasing their bond-length. Such a SWAP operation provides an important step towards the massively parallel creation of a multiparticle entangled state in the lattice.},

The exception is 6Li, where there is a factor-of-7 suppression in the Raman coupling, compared to its already small zero-field value.},

  abstract = {Featuring excellent coherence and operated parallelly, ultracold atoms in optical lattices form a competitive candidate for quantum computation. For this, a massive number of parallel entangled atom pairs have been realized in superlattices. However, the more formidable challenge is to scale-up and detect multipartite entanglement due to the lack of manipulations over local atomic spins in retro-reflected bichromatic superlattices. Here we developed a new architecture based on a cross-angle spin-dependent superlattice for implementing layers of quantum gates over moderately-separated atoms incorporated with a quantum gas microscope for single-atom manipulation. We created and verified functional building blocks for scalable multipartite entanglement by connecting Bell pairs to one-dimensional 10-atom chains and two-dimensional plaquettes of \$2\textbackslash times4\$ atoms. This offers a new platform towards scalable quantum computation and simulation.},

One of the microscope objectives allows local imaging of the trapped Fermi gas of 6Li atoms with a maximum resolution of 660 nm, while the other enables the generation of arbitrary optical dipole potentials on the same length scale. Employing a two-dimensional (2D) acousto-optical deflector, we demonstrate the formation of several trapping geometries, including a tightly focused single optical dipole trap, a 4×4 site 2D optical lattice and an 8 site ring lattice configuration. Furthermore, we show the ability to load and detect a small number of atoms in these trapping potentials. A site separation down to one micrometer in combination with the low mass of 6Li results in tunneling rates that are sufficiently large for the implementation of Hubbard models with the designed geometries.},

Combined with a high magnetic field stability, this allows us to resolve the discrete trap levels in the radio-frequency dissociation spectra. This novel technique allows the binding energy of Feshbach molecules to be determined with unprecedented precision. We use these measurements as an input for a fit to the 6Li scattering potential using coupled-channel calculations. From this new potential, we determine the pole positions of the broad 6Li Feshbach resonances with an accuracy better than 7×10−4 of the resonance widths. This eliminates the dominant uncertainty for current precision measurements of the equation of state of strongly interacting Fermi gases. As an important consequence, our results imply a corrected value for the Bertsch parameter ξ measured by Ku et al. [Science 335, 563 (2012)], which is ξ=0.370(5)(8).},
