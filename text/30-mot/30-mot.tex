\chapter{The 3D Magneto-Optical Trap}\label{ch:mot}

This chapter presents the projected design and planning of the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap and the gray molasses of the FermiQP demonstrator. First, the theory of laser cooling with these two techniques is recapitulated. Subsequently, the implementation of the joint laser setup for both magneto-optical traps and the gray molasses is explained. Afterwards, the intended realization of the magneto-optical trap is described, covering the geometry, the optics for the trapping light, and the magnetic gradients. It concludes with some estimations of key trap properties.

Due to massive supply chain problems and delivery delays during this thesis project, only the trap laser setup and the magnetic gradient coils could be put into operation and characterized during the writing of this thesis. The trap itself will be built when the vacuum chamber has been assembled and depressurized.

\section{Theory of Laser Cooling with Magneto-Optical Traps and Gray Molasses}\label{ch:mot_theory}
Laser light exerting a force onto an atom is the underlying mechanism of laser cooling. There are different implementations, each one making use of a different way light can interact with atoms: Doppler-cooling techniques on the one hand, which are used in, among others, magneto-optical traps, make use of momentum transfer from absorbed photons and are limited regarding the achievable temperature by spontaneous decays. Sub-Doppler-cooling techniques, on the other hand, surpass this limit using other ways of atom-light interaction, such as Raman sideband cooling, Sisyphus cooling, or evaporative cooling in an optical dipole trap~\cite{foot_atomic_2005}.

The following explanations of the theory of magneto-optical traps follow the respective chapters in~\cite{foot_atomic_2005} and~\cite{metcalf_laser_1999}.

\subsection*{Light scattering on atoms}
Electromagnetic waves carry momentum $\vec p = \hbar \vec k$, which is directed into their propagation direction and depends on their wavelength $\lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k}$. When laser light scatters on atoms, a momentum transfer between the photons of the laser and the atoms takes place. The total transfer can be broken down into two parts: the absorption of laser photons where the atoms acquire momentum $\hbar \vec k$ per photon, and the spontaneous emission of photons where the atoms lose $\hbar \vec k_\text{emitted}$ per photon:
\begin{align}
    \vec p_\text{after} &= \vec p_\text{before} + \hbar \vec k - \hbar \vec k_\text{emitted}
\end{align}
While the former is always pointing in the direction of the laser beam, the latter averages to zero over many scattering events as photons are emitted into random directions. In this way, atoms lose momentum over many scattering events if the propagation of the light and the atom movement are in opposite directions:
\begin{align}
    \Braket{\vec p_\text{after} - \vec p_\text{before}} = \Braket{\hbar \vec k} - \underbrace{\Braket{\hbar \vec k_\text{emitted}}}_{=0}
\end{align}
As visualized in figure~\ref{fig:light_scattering_momentum_transfer}, the atoms are thereby decelerated, corresponding to a cooling effect.

\begin{figure}    
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/light_scattering_momentum_transfer/light_scattering_momentum_transfer.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic of momentum transfer from the laser to the atom moving against the laser propagation direction: The momenta of the scattered photons, originating from spontaneous in random directions, average to zero, leading to a net decelerating force over many scattering events.}
    \label{fig:light_scattering_momentum_transfer}
\end{figure}

The rate at which this happens is determined by the steady-state fraction $\rho_{ee}^\text{ss}$ of atoms in the excited state and the rate $\Gamma$ at which they spontaneously decay into the ground state emitting a photon:
\begin{align}
    R_\text{scatter} = \Gamma \rho_{ee}^\text{ss}
\end{align}
The scattering force, which corresponds to the decrease of momentum of the atoms averaged over many scattering events, is hence
\begin{align}
    \vec F_\text{scatter} = R_\text{scatter} \hbar \vec k = \Gamma \rho_{ee}^\text{ss} \hbar \vec k.
\end{align}

The light-atom interaction process can be described semi-classically understanding the light as a classical electromagnetic wave, but describing the dynamics within the atom using the quantum mechanical optical Bloch equations, according to which the steady-state population of the excited state amounts to
\begin{align}
    \rho_{ee}^\text{ss} = \frac{s_0/2}{1 + s_0 + {\left(\frac{2\delta}{\Gamma}\right)}^2},
\end{align}
with the saturation parameter $s_0 = \frac{I}{I_\text{s}} = \frac{2\Omega^2}{\Gamma^2}$, the Rabi frequency $\Omega \propto \sqrt{I}$, and the detuning $\delta$. The detuning is the deviation of the laser frequency from the transition frequency, as it appears to the atom taking into account the Doppler shift stemming from its velocity $\vec v$ with respect to the propagation direction $\vec k$ of the laser:
\begin{align}
    \delta ~~=~~ \underbrace{\omega_\text{laser} - \vec k \cdot \vec v }_{\substack{\text{apparent}\\ \text{laser frequency}}} -~ \omega_\text{transition}
    ~~=~~ \omega_\text{laser}  - \omega_\text{transition} \pm kv \cos \theta
\end{align}
where $+$ is for atoms moving towards and $-$ for atoms moving along with the laser. $\theta$ is the  angle between the atoms' velocity and the propagation direction of the light.

\begin{figure}

    \end{pgfpicture}
    \caption{Scattering rate $R_\text{scatter}$ at $s_0 = 1$ as a function of the atom speed against the laser direction for different values of the detuning $\delta_\text{laser}$: Scattering is maximal where the Doppler shift compensates the detuning, thus $v = \frac{\delta}{k}$.}\label{fig:scattering_rate}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:scattering_rate} shows how the scattering rate and thus also the scattering force depends on the velocity of the atoms. The force is maximal for velocities where the Doppler shift cancels out the laser detuning: $\vec k \cdot \vec v = \omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition}$. Deceleration of atoms happens with red laser detuning $\delta_\text{laser} < 0$ as the light is resonant for atoms moving against the laser propagation direction. These atoms sense the light scattering force against their direction of movement. Atoms moving in the other direction do not sense the scattering force as, for them, the laser is too far detuned (see figure~\ref{fig:scattering_force_detuning}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/scattering_force_detuning/scattering_force_detuning.pdf}
    \caption{Atoms moving against the direction of laser propagation see the laser light blue-shifted, atoms moving in the other direction see it red-shifted. For negative laser detuning ($\delta_\text{laser} < 0$) the former sense the light as it appears to be close to resonance, the latter do not sense it because it is far detuned for them.}\label{fig:scattering_force_detuning}
\end{figure}

\paragraph*{Doppler limit} While the momentum gained by spontaneous emission of photons averages to zero, the square of momentum $\vec p_\text{after decay}^2$ gained from the spontaneous decays does not. This means that the atom is always left with a finite amount of kinetic energy from the recoil of emitted photons. The magnitude of this leftover energy is related to the decay rate $\Gamma$ and is called the Doppler limit of the minimal achievable temperature $T_\text{D}$:
\begin{align}
    k_\text{B} T_\text{D} = \frac{\hbar \Gamma}{2}
\end{align}
Laser cooling techniques using spontaneous emission of photons, by principle, cannot cooling further down than this limit (neglecting any coincidental sub-Doppler cooling effects)~\cite{foot_atomic_2005}.

\subsection*{Magneto-optical Traps}
Magneto-optical traps use light scattering on atoms not only in order to cool, but also in order to spatially confine atoms. They have become a standard tool in ultracold neutral atom experiments over the last decades.

\paragraph{Optical molasses} Magneto-optical traps make use of the optical molasses technique for slowing down atoms. As discussed above, light scattering provides a decelerating force opposite the direction of laser beams in case of red detuning. By using three pairs of counter-propagating laser beams, one pair in each spatial degree of freedom, atoms can be decelerated in each direction. For an atom of speed $v$, travelling at an angle $\theta$ with respect to the counter-propagating beams with wave number $k$, the scattering force of two counter-propagating beams on one axis adds up to
\begin{align}\label{eq:optical_molasses_force}
    F_\text{OM} = F_\text{scatter}(\omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition} - kv \cos \theta) - F_\text{scatter}(\omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition} + kv \cos \theta).
\end{align}
For slow velocities $v \ll \frac{\Gamma}{k}$, the force can be linearized as a friction force:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:optical_molasses_force_linearized}
    \begin{split}
        F_\text{OM} \approx - 2 \pdv{F_\text{scatter}}{\omega} k v \cos \theta \equiv -( \alpha \cos \theta) v
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
with damping 
\begin{align}
    \alpha = 2k \pdv{F}{\omega} = -8 \hbar k^2 s_0 \frac{\delta/\Gamma}{{\left(1+s_0+{{(2\delta/\Gamma)}}^2\right)}^2}    
\end{align}
where low saturation $s_0 \ll 1$ is assumed~\cite{foot_atomic_2005, metcalf_laser_1999}. The velocity-dependence of the optical molasses deceleration force is depicted in figure~\ref{fig:optical_molasses_force}. Slow atoms don't sense a net force whereas moving atoms are decelerated as they compensate the detuning of the light with the Doppler shift. For detunings $\delta \approx -0.5 \Gamma$, the maximum of the force is approximately at the resonance speed, thus at $v \approx \pm \frac{\delta}{k}$.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{pgfpicture}
        \pgftext{\input{\imagepath/optical_molasses_force/optical_molasses_force.pgf}}
    \end{pgfpicture}
    \caption{Optical molasses force $F_\text{OM}$ as a function of velocity for different detunings, as in \eqref{eq:optical_molasses_force}: Due to the Doppler shift, fast atoms are close to resonance and sense the scattering force whereas slow atoms don't sense a net force. For detunings of $\delta \approx -0.5\Gamma$, the maximum force is at $v \approx \frac{\delta}{k}$.}
    \label{fig:optical_molasses_force}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Spatial confinement} For spatial confinement of atoms in magneto-optical traps, the Zeeman effect is exploited. It shifts the energy levels of magnetic substates of angular momentum states at presence of an external magnetic field $B$ by
\begin{align}
    \Delta E(m) = g \mu_\text{B} m B
\end{align}
with the Landé factor $g \approx 2$, the Bohr magneton $\mu_\text{B}$, the magnetic field $B$, and the magnetic quantum number $m$. When applying a magnetic gradient, the transition frequency between two magnetic sublevels $m$ and $m \pm 1$ becomes dependent on the position $q$\footnote{In the following paragraphs, $q$ will be used as a generalized coordinate. In the setup of the FermiQP demonstrator, setting $q = x$ would condition the following considerations to the atomic beam axis ($x$).}:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}\label{eq:omega_transition_zeeman}
      \omega_\text{transition}(q) &= \omega_\text{transition} \pm \frac{\Delta E(q)}{\hbar} \\  
      &= \omega_\text{transition} \pm \frac{g \mu_\text{B}}{\hbar} \pdv{B}{q} q \equiv \omega_\text{transition} \pm \beta q
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Hence the detuning between the laser light and the driven transition becomes position-dependent, which allows for spatially varying scattering forces.

In order to create a confining trap, laser beams and magnetic gradients are calibrated such that the atoms sense restoring forces towards a center point when they are displaced from there. This means that on opposite sides of the trap, these restoring forces must point in opposite directions. One achieves this by clever use of the magnetic gradient and the polarization-dependent selection rules for transitions between magnetic sublevels, as visualized in figures~\ref{fig:restoring_on_opposite_sides_schematic} and~\ref{fig:detuning_and_selection_rules_schematic}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Due to the magnetic gradient, the magnetic field has a different sign on opposite sides of the trap center, hence also the Zeeman shifts $\Delta E$ have opposite signs on opposite sides of the trap, for the transitions $\Delta m = +1$ and $\Delta m = -1$ respectively. This also means that on each side only one of these transitions is close to resonance with the laser light.
    \item $\sigma^+$ light (light with right helicity with respect to the atoms' quantization axis) can only drive transitions with $\Delta m = +1$, $\sigma^-$ light (left helicity) can only drive transitions with $\Delta m = -1$. In each pair of counter-propagating beams, one of the beams has $\sigma^+$ and one has $\sigma^-$ polarization, such that on each side the scattering transition is only driven by the beam propagating towards the trap center.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/restoring_on_opposite_sides_schematic/restoring_on_opposite_sides_schematic.pdf}
    \caption{Restoring mechanism in a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap: Pairs of counter-propagating laser beams in each spatial degree of freedom exert restoring forces on atoms displaced from the center. Setting the beams' circular polarization such that it has $\sigma^+$ helicity where the magnetic field points against the quantization axis, and $\sigma^-$ helicity where the magnetic field points along the quantization axis, ensures that the force is always directed towards the center. See also figure~\ref{fig:detuning_and_selection_rules_schematic}.}
    \label{fig:restoring_on_opposite_sides_schematic}
\end{figure} 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/detuning_and_selection_rules_schematic/detuning_and_selection_rules_schematic.pdf}
    \caption{Details of the restoring mechanism in a magneto-optical trap: On both sides of the trap different transitions between magnetic sublevels are resonant with the red-detuned trap light. Due to the polarization-dependent selection rules, only the  beam pointing towards the center can drive the transition on each side. E.g. on the left, the $\Delta  m = +1$ transition is closer to resonance. Only the $\sigma^+$ light coming from the left can drive this transition, hence atoms displaced to the left of the trap only acquire moment to the right, i.e.~towards the trap center.}
    \label{fig:detuning_and_selection_rules_schematic}
\end{figure}

Note that the helicity of the polarization is given with respect to the (arbitrary, but fixed) quantization axis of the atoms. As the laser beams in each pair counter-propagate, one of them points in and the other one against the direction the quantization axis. The circular polarization with respect to their respective propagation direction is hence the same for both laser beams in a pair (both $\KetText{R}$ or both $\KetText{L}$, depending on the direction of the gradient field).


Similarly to the optical molasses consideration, in the magneto-optical trap the scattering forces can be linearized for small displacements $q \ll \frac{\Gamma}{\beta}$ (here again for one dimension)~\cite{foot_atomic_2005}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mot_force}
    \begin{split}
        F_\text{MOT} &= F_\text{scatter}^{\sigma^+}(\omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition}(q) - kv \cos \theta) - F_\text{scatter}^{\sigma^-}(\omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition}(q) + kv \cos \theta)\\
        &\approx -2 \pdv{F_\text{scatter}}{\omega} k\cos \theta v + 2 \pdv{F_\text{scatter}}{\omega_0} \beta q  \equiv - (\alpha \cos \theta) v - \frac{\alpha \beta}{k} q
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
This demonstrates that a magneto-optical trap combines a friction force $-(\alpha \cos \theta) v$ for slowing down atoms and a trapping force $- \frac{\alpha \beta}{k} q$ confining the atoms to a trap center.

\paragraph{Relevant transitions in alkali atoms}
\sloppy For cooling alkali atoms in a magneto-optical trap, transitions between electronic levels $J_\text{g}$ and $J_\text{g} + 1$ are used for scattering (g denoting the ground state). The cooling transition can be imple\-mented between hyperfine states $\KetSpaced{J = J_\text{g}, F = J_\text{g} + I}$ (the highest $F$ in the $J_\text{g}$ manifold), and $\KetSpaced{J = J_\text{g} + 1, F= J_\text{g} + I + 1}$. This ensures that all decays, owing to the selection rule $\Delta F \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$,  bring the atom down into the original state $\KetSpaced{J = J_\text{g}, F = J_\text{g} + I}$ such that the cooling cycle can start from anew.

If, however, the atom is excited into the $\KetSpaced{J = J_\text{g} + 1, F = J_\text{g} + I}$ state due to a non-zero matrix element for this transition, it can also fall back into the $\KetSpaced{J = J_\text{g}, F = J_\text{g} + I - 1}$ state. In this case, it would not be subject to cooling anymore as this state is dark to the cooling transition. To combat this, a repumper laser beam is shone in in addition to the cooler beam. This beam addresses the transition $\KetSpaced{J = J_\text{g}, F = J_\text{g} + I - 1} \rightarrow \KetSpaced{J = J_\text{g} + 1, F = J_\text{g} + I}$ from where they can decay back into the ground state of the cooling transition, which returns them into the cooling cycle~\cite{metcalf_laser_1999}.

The cooling and repumping mechanism is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:cooler_repumper_in_alkali}, the respective cascades can be summarized as
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:cooler_cascade}\text{cooling:}~~~~~ & \KetSpaced{J_\text{g},J_\text{g} + I} \underset{\text{cooler}}{\longrightarrow} \KetSpaced{J_\text{g} + 1, J_\text{g} + I + 1} \rightsquigarrow  \KetSpaced{J_\text{g}, J_\text{g} + I}\\
    \label{eq:repumper_cascade}\text{repumping:}~~~~~ & \KetSpaced{J_\text{g} + 1, J_\text{g} + I} \underset{\text{loss}}{\rightsquigarrow} \KetSpaced{J_\text{g}, J_\text{g} + I - 1}  \underset{\text{repumper}}{\longrightarrow} \KetSpaced{J_\text{g} + 1, J_\text{g} + I} \rightsquigarrow  \KetSpaced{J_\text{g}, J_\text{g} + I}
\end{align}
with notation in the $\KetSpaced{J, F}$ basis.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/cooler_repumper_in_alkali/cooler_repumper_in_alkali.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic of the cooling and repumping scheme in an alkali atom, here exemplarily for fermionic $^6$Li atoms ($I = 1, J_\text{g} = \frac{1}{2}$): The cooling cycle is $\Ket{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}} \rightarrow \Ket{\frac{3}{2}, \frac{5}{2}} \rightsquigarrow \Ket{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}}$. Atoms are lost if, during cooling, they end up in the $\Ket{\frac{3}{2}, \frac{3}{2}}$ state and decay down into the $\Ket{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}}$ state. The repumper then leads them back into the cooling cycle via $\Ket{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}} \rightarrow \Ket{\frac{3}{2}, \frac{3}{2}} \rightsquigarrow \Ket{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}}$. As in $^6$Li the $^2\text{P}_{3/2}$ manifold is not resolved for the cooler and repumper transitions, the loss decay happens very often, and the rates of cooling and repumping are on the same order of magnitude. The detuning of the cooler and the repumper have been neglected in this schematic.}
    \label{fig:cooler_repumper_in_alkali}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Characteristic Quantities and Benchmarks}
Important technical quantities that can be adjusted for optimizing the performance of a MOT include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item laser intensity saturations $s_{0, \text{cooler}}$ and $s_{0, \text{repumper}}$
    \item laser detunings with respect to the transition wavelength $\delta_\text{cooler}$ and $\delta_\text{repumper}$
    \item the angle $\theta$ of the atomic beam with respect to the cooling laser beams
    \item magnetic gradient $\pdv{B}{q}$
\end{itemize}

These quantities, except the angle $\theta$, might also be varied over one trapping cycle, e.g. for compressing the trap and cooling the atoms further down by increasing the magnetic gradient and decreasing the laser intensity as well as the absolute laser detuning.

A magneto-optical trap can be characterized by, among others, the following quantities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The radius $r_\text{trap}$ of the trapping region where the atoms are slowed  is on the order of the size of the trapping beams: $r_\text{trap} \approx w$ (beam waist radius).
    \item One can estimate a maximum velocity $v_\text{max, capture}$ such that the atoms entering the trap are decelerated to standstill within the length $2r_\text{trap}$ of the trap. This would require that their kinetic energy $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ be dissipated by the cooling force performing the mechanical work $\int F_\text{MOT}(q) \dd{q}$. In case of high radiation pressure, this can be approximated with the maximum scattering force $F_\text{scatter, max}(q) = \frac{\hbar k \Gamma}{2}$ being constant over the whole trap diameter $2 r_\text{trap}$, leading to the following capture velocity \cite{lunden_enhancing_2020}:
    \begin{align}\label{eq:capture_velocity_high}
        v_\text{capture, max}^\text{high} \approx \sqrt{\frac{\hbar k \Gamma \cdot 2 r_\text{trap}}{m}}.
    \end{align}
     For a lower scattering force ($s_0 \ll 1$), the work is $\int F_\text{MOT}(q)\dd{q}= \int (-\alpha \cos \theta v(q) - \frac{\alpha\beta}{k}q) \dd{q} = - \int \alpha \cos \theta v(q) \dd{q}$ (see equation~\ref{eq:mot_force}):
    \begin{align}
            v_\text{max, capture}^\text{low}
            = \sqrt{\frac{2}{m} \int\limits_{-r_\text{trap}}^{+r_\text{trap}} F_\text{MOT}(q) \dd{q}} 
            \approx \sqrt{\frac{2}{m} \alpha \cos \theta \cdot \frac{v_\text{max, capture}}{2} \cdot 2r_\text{trap}}
    \end{align}
    where the integral over the velocity was estimated as $\int\limits_{-r_\text{trap}}^{+r_\text{trap}}  v(q) \dd{q} \approx \frac{v_\text{max}}{2} \cdot 2r_\text{trap}$, assuming that the velocity in the trap is reduced at a constant rate until standstill. The capture velocity is then estimated as
    \begin{align}\label{eq:capture_velocity_low}
        v_\text{max, capture}^\text{low} \approx \frac{2 \alpha \cos \theta ~ r_\text{trap}}{m}.
    \end{align}
    Figure \ref{fig:capture_velocity_comparison} compares the two estimations of the capture velocity. For small saturation intensities, $v_\text{max, capture}^\text{low}$ takes into consideration that the slowing force is weak, hence only slow atoms can be brought to standstill in the trap. For higher saturation intensities, where it loses applicability, $v_\text{max, capture}^\text{low}$ approaches $v_\text{max, capture}^\text{high}$ which is an upper bound of the capture velocity.
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \begin{pgfpicture}
            \pgftext{\input{\imagepath/capture_velocity_comparison/capture_velocity_comparison.pgf}}
        \end{pgfpicture}
        \caption[]{Comparison between the different estimations of the capture velocity: The low-intensity capture velocity $v_\text{max, capture}^\text{low}$ takes the low scattering force at $s_0 \ll 1$ into consideration, approaching the intensity-ignorant upper-bound capture velocity $v_\text{max, capture}^\text{high}$ for ${s_0 > 1}$. Parameters: $\delta = -5\Gamma$, ${r_\text{trap} = \SI[]{7}{\milli\meter}}, {\theta = \SI[]{0}{\degree}}$.}
        \label{fig:capture_velocity_comparison}
    \end{figure}
    \item For atoms of velocity $v$, the trap size is also set by the distance $r_\text{resonance}$ from the trap center where the trapping beams are resonant due to the Zeeman shift, i.e.~${\omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition} - \vec k \cdot \vec v = \frac{g \mu_\text{B}}{\hbar} \pdv{B}{q} r_\text{resonance}}$, from which follows~\cite{tiecke_high-flux_2009}
    \begin{align}\label{eq:resonance_radius}
        r_\text{resonance}(\vec v) = \frac{\hbar}{g \mu_\text{B}} \left(\pdv{B}{q}\right)^{-1} \left((\omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition}) - \vec k \cdot \vec v\right).
    \end{align}
     At larger distances from the trap, the trapping light is blue detuned (see figure~\ref{fig:detuning_and_selection_rules_schematic}) and thus not decelerating, hence slowing of atoms of velocity $\vec v$ only occurs within a distance of $r_\text{resonance}(\vec v)$. In a one-dimensional consideration with $\vec k \cdot \vec v = - kv \cos\theta$, one can deduce a maximum speed at which atoms entering the trap can still be on resonance at the outermost displacement $r_\text{trap}$~\cite{tiecke_high-flux_2009}:
    \begin{align}\label{eq:resonance_velocity}
        v_\text{max, resonance} \approx \frac{1}{k \cos \theta}
        \left(
            \frac{g \mu_\text{B}}{\hbar} \pdv{B}{q} r_\text{trap} - \left(\omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition}\right)
        \right)
    \end{align}
    Assuming that the slowing force is large, one can assume that, on the way towards the trap center, the atoms are kept close to resonance with the ever less detuned trapping light (due to the magnetic gradient along the trajectory through the trap). In this case, $v_\text{max, resonance}$ can also give the order of magnitude of the capture velocity of the trap~\cite{tiecke_high-flux_2009}.
    \item The loading rate quantifies the initial increase of the number of atoms trapped per time unit. It depends on the trap geometry, the flux and the velocity distribution of the incoming atoms, the applied gradients, laser powers, detunings of the cooling and repumping light, collisions among the trapped atoms, and many more. Due to these complex dependencies, the loading rate needs to be characterized experimentally.
    \item The temperature of the atoms in the trap is usually one order of magnitude greater than the Doppler temperature $T_\text{D}$ and also depends on a multitude of parameters.
    \item Regarding the trap as a harmonic oscillator, one can quantify the atom oscillation frequency $\omega_\text{MOT} = \frac{\alpha}{m}$, oscillation damping rate $\Gamma_\text{MOT} = \sqrt{\frac{\alpha \beta}{km}}$, and atom trap restoring time $t_\text{restore} = \frac{2\Gamma_\text{MOT}}{\omega_\text{MOT}^2}$ with the atom mass $m$~\cite{metcalf_laser_1999}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Magneto-optical Traps with Lithium}\label{ch:3d_mots_with_li}
Magneto-optical traps for lithium usually operate on the D$_2$ line, i.e.~between the $^2\text{S}_{1/2}$ and $^2\text{P}_{3/2}$ manifolds, as in the implementation in the FermiQP demonstrator. Since the first implementation with lithium in the early 1990s \cite{kawanaka_decay_1993}, they have become a standard part of ultracold lithium experiments, namely for experiments with fermionic~\cite{duarte_all-optical_2011,omran_microscopic_2015} and bosonic~\cite{kawanaka_decay_1993,schunemann_magneto-optic_1998} lithium as well as for isotope mixtures \cite{mewes_simultaneous_1999, schreck_sympathetic_2001, hilker_laser_2012, kerkmann_novel_2019} and species mixtures~\cite{ladouceur_compact_2009,tiecke_high-flux_2009,chen_lithium-cesium_2021}.

For D$_2$ line traps for fermionic lithium, the energy splitting between the two ground state hyperfine manifolds $\KetSpaced{J=1/2, F=1/2}$ and $\KetSpaced{J=1/2, F=3/2}$ is \SI{228}{\mega\hertz}, which sets the order of magnitude for the difference in frequency of the cooler and repumper laser beams. The cooler addresses the transition $\Ket{^2\text{S}_{1/2}, F = 3/2} \rightarrow \Ket{^2\text{P}_{3/2}}$, the repumper addresses the transition $\Ket{^2\text{S}_{1/2}, F = 1/2} \rightarrow \Ket{^2\text{P}_{3/2}}$, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:lithium_level_diagram}.

It is important to note that the hyperfine levels $F = \frac{5}{2}$, $\frac{3}{2}$, and $\frac{1}{2}$ of the excited state cannot be resolved because the D$_2$ line is broader ($\Gamma = 2\pi \cdot \SI[]{5.87}{\mega\hertz}$) than the splitting between these hyperfine states (\SI[]{4.4}{\mega\hertz})~\cite{gehm_properties_2003}. This implies that it is impossible to control which hyperfine state the cooler excites the atoms into. A large fraction of them will hence drop into the $\KetSpaced{J=1/2, F=1/2}$ state and need to be repumped back into the cycle. For this reason, the cooler and repumper roughly have equal importance in a Lithium magneto-optical trap and should thus also have comparable power. Another implication is that coincidental sub-Doppler cooling, as observed in magneto-optical traps for other atomic species, cannot be expected to support the cooling process~\cite{grier_lambda-enhanced_2013}.

Typical parameter ranges for three-dimensional traps with lithium from other experiments are~\cite{

}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item laser intensities: from a few up to more than $10$ saturation intensities, with a little less power on the repumper
    \item beam diameter: \SIrange{5}{15}{\milli\meter}
    \item detuning: mostly around $-5\Gamma$, also up to $-8 \Gamma$ (\cite{li_enhanced_2015}), with the repumper often being less detuned than the cooler
    \item magnetic gradients: \SIrange{10}{50}{\gauss\per\centi\meter}
    \item capture velocity: about \SIrange[]{30}{100}{\meter\per\second} 
    \item achieved temperature: on the order of \SI[]{1}{\milli\kelvin} to \SI[]{300}{\micro\kelvin}
    \item loading rate: about \SIrange[]{e7}{e9}{} $\frac{\text{atoms}}{\si[]{\second}}$
    \item atom number in the trap: about \SIrange{e7}{e10}{}
\end{itemize}

Lower temperatures than in magneto-optical traps operating on the D$_2$ line have been reached by using a UV transition~\cite{duarte_all-optical_2011,omran_microscopic_2015}, which, however, requires expensive laser sources and optical components~\cite{burchianti_efficient_2014}. More efficient loading rates have been achieved by adding frequency sidebands onto the cooling light in order to address more velocity classes~\cite{li_enhanced_2015}.

The hyperfine splitting in the $^2\text{S}_{1/2}$ manifold is \SI{228}{\mega\hertz}.}
    \label{fig:lithium_level_diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Gray Molasses Cooling}
The subsequent step in the cooling cycle in the FermiQP demonstrator, after the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap, is gray molasses cooling~\cite{grynberg_proposal_1994,weidemuller_novel_1994}. This sub-Doppler cooling technique operates on the D$_1$ line of lithium, i.e. the $^2\text{S}_{1/2} \rightarrow {^2\text{P}_{1/2}}$ transition~\cite{burchianti_efficient_2014}.

Gray molasses is based on atoms moving in a polarization-gradient field where they move up a potential hill until they decay into a lower energy state, similar to Sisyphus cooling~\cite{foot_atomic_2005}. Gray molasses operate on $\Delta J = 0$ transitions, as is the case for the D$_1$ line. This transition functions as a $\Lambda$-system with the two ground states being the states $\Ket{\text{ground}, m}$ and $\Ket{\text{ground}, m + 2}$ and the excited state being $\Ket{\text{excited}, m + 1}$~\cite{weidemuller_novel_1994}, as illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:gray_molasses_level_diagram}. Coupling between these states is polarization-dependent due to dipole selection rules.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{\imagepath/gray_molasses_level_diagram/gray_molasses_level_diagram.pdf}
    \caption{$\Lambda$-system used in gray molasses cooling: It consists of two manifolds with equal $J$, connecting the two magnetic sublevels $m$ and $m+2$ in the ground state via $m+1$ in the excited state.}
    \label{fig:gray_molasses_level_diagram}
\end{figure}

The counter-propagating gray molasses beams have orthogonal polarization, e.g. circular polarization with different helicity. At every point, the superposition of the polarization states of both beams yields an effective polarization sensed by the atoms. This position-dependent effective polarization depends on the local phase of the two light beams with respect to each other, which means that the atoms see alternating circular, elliptical, linear, elliptical, etc.~polarization along their journey through the light field. This makes the coupling between the relevant states position-dependent, as hinted at in figure~\ref{fig:gray_molasses_polarization_gradient}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{\imagepath/gray_molasses_polarization_gradient/gray_molasses_polarization_gradient.pdf}
    \caption{Polarization-gradient in the gray molasses scheme: Atoms move along the light field and see different energy shifts $E_c$ depending on their position. At positions with low light shift, the polarization allows them to transition from the dark state $\Ket{\text{D}}$ to the coupling state $\Ket{\text{C}}$ and move further in the light field losing kinetic energy until they decay back.}
    \label{fig:gray_molasses_polarization_gradient}
\end{figure}

In the gray molasses' light field, the $\Lambda$-system is dressed with two orthogonal, hence not mutually coupling, eigenstates $\Ket{\text{C}}$ and $\Ket{\text{D}}$, being superpositions of the two ground states. One of them, $\Ket{\text{C}}$, couples to the light field via the excited state and experiences an energy shift $E_C \propto \frac{\Omega_\text{eff}^2}{\delta}$. The other, $\Ket{\text{D}}$, is a dark state~\cite{weidemuller_novel_1994,gerken_gray_2016}.

The absence of coupling between these two states only persists as long as the atoms' kinetic energy is not considered. For atoms with momentum $p$, there is a non-zero transition probability $P \propto \left|\frac{p}{E_C} \right|^2$~\cite{weidemuller_novel_1994}. This means that faster atoms are more prone to transition from the dark state to the coupling state, and that this transition is most likely in areas with low light shift.

The cooling effect in this scheme can now be understood as follows: Atoms move along the gray molasses light field with a velocity $v > 0$. At points with low light shift due to the polarization gradient, they are likely to transition from the dark state $\Ket{\text{D}}$ to the coupling state $\Ket{\text{C}}$. Moving further in the polarization-gradient field, their light shift energy $E_C$ increases, at the cost of their kinetic energy. When they spontaneously decay back into the dark state $\Ket{\text{D}}$ they lose an amount of energy on the order of the light shift $E_C$. This is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:gray_molasses_polarization_gradient}. The gray molasses light needs to be blue detuned ($\delta > 0$) because then the light shift is positive such that the atoms lose energy when falling back into the dark state $\Ket{\text{D}}$. With this scheme,  temperatures even below the recoil limit $T_\text{recoil}$ can be reached~\cite{weidemuller_novel_1994,gerken_gray_2016}.


\paragraph{Gray Molasses with Lithium} The D$_1$ line of lithium is just \SI{10}{\giga\hertz} off the D$_2$ line. This avoids the need for a separate laser system in a different wavelength regime and  allows reusing the optics of the magneto-optical trap for the gray molasses. Similar to the magneto-optical trap, a cooler and a repumper are needed: the former is blue detuned with respect to the $\Ket{^2\text{S}_{1/2}, F = 3/2} \rightarrow \Ket{^2\text{P}_{1/2}, F = 3/2}$ transition, the latter is blue detuned with respect to the $\Ket{^2\text{S}_{1/2}, F = 1/2} \rightarrow \Ket{^2\text{P}_{1/2}, F = 3/2}$. In contrast to cooling on the D$_2$ line, the excited manifold of the D$_1$ line is resolved, meaning the splitting between its excited state's hyperfine levels is larger than the linewidth~\cite{gerken_gray_2016}.

\citeauthor{burchianti_efficient_2014} implemented gray molasses for fermionic lithium in 2014 reaching temperatures of about \SI[]{40}{\micro\kelvin}. Their parameters were taken as a reference starting point for configuring the gray molasses of the FermiQP demonstrator setup~\cite{burchianti_efficient_2014}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item laser intensities: $s_{0, \text{cooler}} = 2.7$, $\frac{s_{0, \text{repumper}}}{s_{0, \text{cooler}}} \approx 0.2$
    \item detunings: $\delta_\text{cooler} = +5.4 \Gamma$, varying $\delta_\text{repumper}$ between $(\delta_\text{cooler} -2 \Gamma)$ and  $(\delta_\text{cooler}+ 3\Gamma)$
\end{itemize}
with $I_s = \SI{7.59}{\milli\watt\per\square\centi\meter}$ and $\Gamma = 2\pi \cdot \SI{5.87}{\mega\hertz}$ for the D$_1$ line~\cite{gehm_properties_2003}.

In the following two sections, the laser setup for and the projected implementation of the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap and the gray molasses in the FermiQP demonstrator will be described.


\section{Preparation of the Trap Laser Light}\label{ch:light_preparation}
In the FermiQP demonstrator, the cooling laser light for the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional magneto-optical traps as well as for the gray molasses is jointly produced on an optics board from where it is transferred to the experiment chamber via optical fibers.

The laser beams originate from two laser sources, one for D$_2$ light for the magneto-optical traps and one for D$_1$ light for the gray molasses. All beams produced by the setup consist of cooler and repumper light, which are separated by about \SI{228}{\mega\hertz}, the hyperfine splitting of the $^2\text{S}_{1/2}$ ground state. For the two-dimensional magneto-optical trap, the frequencies of the cooler and repumper light, as well as their powers are fixed. For the three-dimensional trap and the gray molasses light they need to be variable over an experiment cycle in order to compress and optimize the traps dynamically. The light for the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap and the gray molasses is prepared on the same optical path, which is possible as both cooling schemes are carried out at the same position and which allows reusing the deployed optics components. All beams need to have sufficient power levels such that several saturation intensities on the respective trap cross-sections are in reach for the \SI{30}{\milli\meter} beam of the two-dimensional trap and the \SI{7}{\milli\meter} beams for the three-dimensional trap  and for the gray molasses cooling.

\subsection*{Laser sources}
The \SI{671}{\nano\meter} laser light for the D$_2$ and D$_1$ lines is produced for all aforementioned cooling beams by two Raman fiber amplifiers (MPB VRFA-P-1500-671-SF-PLUS, \textit{Socrates} and \textit{Plato}) with a specified output power of \SI{1.5}{\watt} each, which is substantially more than the optical power available to previous experiments. The amplifiers are supplied with seed light by two single-mode diode lasers at \SI{1342}{\nano\meter} (Toptica MDL pro, \textit{Heraklitus} seeding \textit{Socrates}, and \textit{Zeno} seeding \textit{Plato}), delivering around \SI{20}{\milli\watt} of power. Each fiber amplifier contains a frequency-doubling stage creating a \SI{671}{\nano\meter} laser beam of \SI{1}{\milli\meter} diameter from the amplified \SI{1342}{\nano\meter} light. The seed lasers are offset-locked to a global reference laser that itself is locked to an ultra-low expansion cavity. The offset locking allows shifting the laser frequencies of the D$_2$ and the D$_1$ light arbitrarily by up to \SI[]{10}{\giga\hertz}. The interplay of these lasers is outlined in figure~\ref{fig:laser_interplay_schematic}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/laser_interplay_schematic/laser_interplay_schematic.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic of the cooling laser setup: Two Raman fiber amplifiers  (RFA) provide light for the optics setups that prepare the light used in the magneto-optical traps and the gray molasses. This light is offset-locked via the amplifiers' seeds to a global reference laser which, in turn, is locked to a reference cavity.}
    \label{fig:laser_interplay_schematic}
\end{figure}

The main advantage of using the Raman fiber amplifiers is that they produce enough optical power to simultaneously supply all three aforementioned traps with light. An alternative would be separate laser sources for every beam, each of which would need to be frequency-locked and monitored independently. During the writing of the thesis, the Raman fiber amplifiers showed signs of substantial degradation as their output power decreased by over \SI{30}{\percent} in only a few weeks of intermittent operation. The details and the severity of this degradation are presented in~\cite{qesja_notitle_2022}. As the experimenters of FermiQP as well as the manufacturer of the amplifier could not come up with a quick and reliable solution to this problem that could be verified during the writing of this thesis, it stays uncertain whether the Raman fiber amplifiers can be used long-term for the laser cooling within the FermiQP demonstrator. An alternative approach would be amplification of the seed light using tapered amplifier chips.

\subsection*{Outline of the Laser Setup}
The output beams, all consisting of cooler and repumper light, with variable frequencies and powers for the 3-dimensional trap and the gray molasses, are created from the two input beams on the D$_2$ and the D$_1$ frequency as schematized in figure~\ref{fig:laser_setup_schematic}.

The most important optical components used in the laser setup as well as their technical specifications are reviewed in the appendix chapter~\ref{ch:optical_components}. Most notably, acousto-optic modulators are used for frequency-shifting the light on the order of \SI{100}{\mega\hertz}. Taking advantage of the fact that the frequency-shift in these modulators is accompanied by a beam deflection by a frequency-dependent angle, they are also employed in combination with mechanical shutters for switching beams on and off programmatically. Wherever this deflection is not desirable, it can, however, be circumvented by sending the beam through the modulator twice using a mirror such that the deflections cancel out, which is called a double-pass arrangement.

    \caption{Schematic of the laser setup for preparing the cooling light for the magneto-optical traps and the gray molasses: D$_2$ light is split into two branches for the two-dimensional (to the right) and the three-dimensional magneto-optical (to the bottom) traps at the first PBS (A).\\
    For the light for the two-dimensional trap, a small amount of power is taken out for the push beam (B) before it is split into cooler and repumper light (C) and frequency-shifted by \SI[]{+-114}{\mega\hertz} on acousto-optic modulators. It is then recombined (D) and split into two outputs (E). There is consideration to add an electro-optical modulator (EOM) for improving the cooling effect of the light. This part of the laser setup was constructed within the scope of this thesis (gray box).\\

    \label{fig:laser_setup_schematic}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

The laser setup consists of the following sections:

\paragraph{D$_\textsf{2}$ Light} The D$_2$ light is offset-locked at \SI{-78}{\mega\hertz} below the actual D$_2$ transition frequency. It is split on a polarizing beam splitter into two paths for the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (marker A in figure~\ref{fig:laser_setup_schematic}). The power splitting ratio was preliminarily planned as about $\frac{1}{3}$ for the three-dimensional and $\frac{2}{3}$ for the two-dimensional optical trap since the two-dimensional trap needs to reach the required intensity for a larger trap cross-section, and it is the first cooling stage of the experiment bridging the large range from several hundred Kelvin to sub-Kelvin temperatures on two of the three spatial axes.

\paragraph{2D Trap Branch} The branch for the two-dimensional trap can be blocked using a shutter and an acousto-optic modulator used as a fast optical switch steered by the experiment control system. The shutter is a loudspeaker magnet with a beam blocker attached to it and acts as an additional slow controllable beam blockade ensuring that definitely no light can pass. This acousto-optic modulator increases the laser frequency by \SI{+78}{\mega\hertz} such that the light is resonant with the D$_2$ transition again. Using another half-wave plate and beam splitter, a small fraction of the laser power is branched off for the push beam (B). This light is frequency-shifted by \SI{+114}{\mega\hertz} in order to be resonant with the cooler transition. The remaining light is used in the trap.

The experimenters consider adding an electro-optical modulator at this point for improving the trap. This modulator would add frequency sidebands at several \si{\mega\hertz} to the light. In the trap, these additional frequencies would address other velocity classes than the original light and might hence increase the loading rate of the trap.

After that the light is split in a power ratio of approximately $1$:$1$ into cooler and repumper beams (C), each of which is fed through an acousto-optic modulator with driving frequencies of \SI{-114}{\mega\hertz} and \SI{+114}{\mega\hertz} for cooler and repumper respectively. This corresponds to the hyperfine splitting of the ground state manifold. When the magneto-optical traps are implemented, the frequency splitting between cooler and repumper might be experimentally optimized for maximizing fluorescence of the two-dimensional and loading rate of the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap. The two beams are then spatially overlapped on a beam splitter (D) and fed to two optical fibers leading to the experiment chamber (E).

\paragraph{3D Trap and Gray Molasses Branch} From the branch of the D$_2$ light for the three-dimensional trap, a small amount is branched off for offset-locking. The remaining light is sent through a modulator-shutter combination for programmatic beam blocking as explained above, here with a modulator frequency of \SI{-198}{\mega\hertz}. It is then spatially overlapped with the D$_1$ light (F). The D$_1$ light is also offset by \SI{+78}{\mega\hertz}, a part of it split off for offset locking, and fed through an identical programmatic beam blockade.

The combined beam of D$_2$ and D$_1$ light is then also split into two paths for cooler and repumper in a ratio of approximately $1$:$1$ (G). Here, however, the light is fed through acousto-optic modulator double-passes as described in~\cite{qesja_notitle_2022}. As the net deflection is zero in double-passes, it allows a programmatic change of the frequency shift applied to each beam without the need to realign the beam path. Together with the ability to damp the laser power by reducing the modulators' radio-frequency driving power, frequency, and power of each beam can be independently steered for compressing the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap and for switching powers when applying the gray molasses. The cooler beam is frequency-shifted by about \SI{+162}{\mega\hertz}, the repumper by about \SI{+390}{\mega\hertz}, with the double-passes allowing for an adjustment range of several tens of \si{\mega\hertz}. The total frequency shift considering the initial offset, the blockade modulators and modulator amounts to $\SI{-78}{\mega\hertz} - \SI{198}{\mega\hertz} + \SI{390}{\mega\hertz} = \SI{+114}{\mega\hertz}$ in the cooler path and $\SI{-78}{\mega\hertz} - \SI{198}{\mega\hertz} + \SI{162}{\mega\hertz} = \SI{-114}{\mega\hertz}$ in the repumper path, which is again the hyperfine splitting of the ground state manifold. The light is then recombined (H) and split into three output beams (I) sent to the experiment chamber via optical fibers.

\subsection*{Implementation of the Laser Setup for the two-dimensional Magneto-optical Trap}
Within this thesis, the part of the laser setup providing the light for the two-dimensional magneto-optical trap, as highlighted in figure~\ref{fig:laser_setup_schematic}, was built.
Figure~\ref{fig:2d_mot_setup_photo} shows a photograph of the implementation of this part of the setup. The light is prepared on the optics board in the following steps (letters reference markers in figure~\ref{fig:2d_mot_setup_photo}):

Lowering the beam diameter is a trade-off between a slimmer beam waist $w_0$ and a larger beam divergence $\frac{\lambda}{\pi w_0}$ leading to even larger beam diameters after some propagation distance. To combat the increased divergence after the telescope, another focusing lens was installed at k. The evolution of the beam diameter is shown in figure~\ref{fig:beam_diameter_evolution}.

\section{Projected Implementation}\label{ch:projected_implementation}
In this section, the projected implementation of the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap is presented. The intended geometry of the trap setup serves as a starting point for elaborating the arrangement and configuration of the optical setup around the glass cell for the trapping beams. The range of possible magnetic gradients is shortly mentioned. The section concludes with a forecast about key properties of the trap.

\subsection*{Geometry}
The three-dimensional magneto-optical trap of the FermiQP demonstrator is loaded from the atomic beam originating from the two-dimensional magneto-optical trap. It is guided through a differential pumping stage separating the high and the ultra-high vacuum regions of the experiment chamber. The trap is located in the front part of the glass cell, the space around which is tightly packed with the two microscope objectives sitting above and below the trap and the Feshbach coils placed left and right of the incoming atomic beam, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:glass_cell_vicinity}. As a reminder, the reference coordinate system of the experiment chamber is that $x$ is along the atomic beam, $y$ is to the left as seen in the direction of the atomic beam, and $z$ is in upward direction.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{\imagepath/glass_cell_vicinity/glass_cell_vicinity.pdf}
    \caption{Position of the glass cell between the microscope objectives and the Feshbach coils. The tightly packed vicinity of the glass cell determines the geometry of the magneto-optical trap.}\label{fig:glass_cell_vicinity}
\end{figure}

The magneto-optical trap needs three pairs of beams, one for each spatial degree of freedom that the atoms should be cooled along. For each pair, a beam is shot in from one side and retroreflected after passing through the glass cell. Due to the tightly packed vicinity of the glass cell, the beam axes cannot be matched with the Cartesian coordinate axes: no beams can be shot along the $z$ axis which is blocked by the objectives, and no beam can be shot directly along the atomic beam axis ($x$) because no retroreflection would be possible on the other side of the glass cell.

Instead, two beams are shone in in the $xz$ plane where they fit through: The geometry of the microscope objectives only permits shooting them into the glass cell at shallow angles, namely with an incidence angle of \SI{60}{\degree} with respect to the surface normal of the glass cell, as depicted in figure~\ref{fig:glass_cell_sides_mot_beams_0}. These beams provide cooling and confinement along the atomic beam axis ($x$, with an angle of $\theta = \SI{30}{\degree}$ between light propagation $\vec k$ and velocity $\vec v$ of the atomic beam) and the up-down axis ($y$). The third beam is shot in along the $y$ axis, i.e.\ from left to right (see figure~\ref{fig:glass_cell_sides_mot_beams_1}). The beams are reflected back on reflection stages a bit away from the glass cell.

The glass cell has a side length of \SI{20}{\milli\meter} and \SI{4}{\milli\meter}-thick walls. Dimensions are to scale in this schematic. The change of the incidence angle of the $xz$ beams within the glass due to refraction was neglected in this schematic.}

\end{figure} 

\subsection*{Optics around the Experiment Chamber}
The six cooling laser beams for the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap are transferred from the optics board to the experiment chamber with optical fibers where they are outcoupled and prepared on outcoupling stages. 

The $y$ beam will be reflected back directly on a reflection stage at the other side of the glass cell. The two $xz$ beams are shot into the glass cell from the upper and lower front of the glass cell through the upper surfaces. For reflecting them back into the glass cell, they are first guided away from the experiment chamber onto stand-alone reflection stages as there wouldn't be enough space for these stages between the vacuum chamber and the glass cell (see figure~\ref{fig:mot_optics_schematic_from_above}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/mot_optics_schematic_from_above/mot_optics_schematic_from_above.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic of the optics for the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap from above: The trapping light is coupled out of the fibers coming from the optics boards on outcopling stages. After passing through the glass cell, they are reversed on reflection stages such that they pass through the glass cell another time. The reflection stages of the $xz$ beams would not fit between the glass cell and the vacuum chamber. Instead, the $xz$ beams are reflected away from the chamber on a mirror onto the $xz$ reflection stages away from the chamber.}
    \label{fig:mot_optics_schematic_from_above}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Outcoupling Stages}
The outcoupling stages consist of optical elements for collimating, polarization-cleaning, and polarization-preparing the light, mounted in an optical cage system. A schematic of the stages is shown in figure~\ref{fig:outcoupling_stage_schematic}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\imagepath/outcoupling_stage_schematic/outcoupling_stage_schematic.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic of the outcoupling stages in an optical cage system: The trapping light coming from an optical fiber is collimated with an achromatic lens with a focal length of \SI{35}{\milli\meter} such that the beam has a $\frac{1}{e^2}$ diameter of \SI{7}{\milli\meter}. The polarization is cleaned using a half-wave plate and a polarizing beam splitter the light is transmitted through. With a beam sampler a small amount of light is reflected out of the axis and shot onto a photodiode for power monitoring. The clean linear light is then polarization-prepared on a quarter- and a half-wave plate and reflected out on a mirror cube.}
    \label{fig:outcoupling_stage_schematic}
\end{figure}

The light leaving the optical fiber has a divergence angle of $\theta_\text{divergence} = \frac{\lambda}{\pi w} = \frac{\SI{671}{\nano\meter}}{\pi\SI{2.25}{\micro\meter}} = \SI{95}{\milli\radian}$ set by the beam waist $w = \SI{2.25}{\micro\meter}$ at the fiber tip. In order to collimate it to a beam of $\frac{1}{e^2}$ diameter of \SI{7}{\milli\meter}, hence radius of $r_{1/e^2} = \SI{3.5}{\milli\meter}$, a lens of focal length $f = \frac{r_{1/e^2}}{\tan \theta_\text{divergence}} = \frac{\SI{3.5}{\milli\meter}}{\SI{95}{\milli\radian}} \approx \SI{35}{\milli\meter}$~\cite{noauthor_collimated_2021} is installed in the outcoupling stage such that the fiber tip is in the focal point.

In order to get rid of non-linear polarization components that the light might have acquired while travelling in the fiber, it is cleaned using a combination of a half-wave plate\footnote{This half-wave plate is even dispensable if the fiber is well aligned with the beam splitter cube.} and a polarizing beam splitter it is transmitted through.

Then a beam sampler reflects out a small fraction of the light onto a photodiode for power monitoring. Note that the power is monitored after polarization cleaning in order to check the effective power that is available for trapping\footnote{The power is not monitored on the other beam splitter port as then one could not distinguish between polarization-induced and supply-induced power changes. It is also not checked by monitoring the transmitted power on one of the system's back-polished mirrors as the absolute power transmitted through these mirrors would be too little.}.

Finally, the polarization of the trapping beam can be set using a quarter- and a half-wave plate.

\paragraph{Reflection Stages}
The reflection stages consist of an cascade of a quarter-, a half-, and another quarter-wave plate and a mirror mounted in a cage system, as depicted in figure~\ref{fig:reflection_stage_schematic}. This threefold wave plate combination is traversed by the light twice, forwards and backwards, and allows for arbitrary changes of polarization. Only using two wave plates in the reflection stage would not suffice as a combination of only one quarter- and one half-wave plate cannot map every polarization to any other arbitrary polarization, as pointed out in the appendix chapter~\ref{ch:optical_components}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.77]{\imagepath/reflection_stage_schematic/reflection_stage_schematic.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic of the reflection stage in an optical cage system: Incoming light is sent through a quarter-, a half-, and another quarter-wave plate, and then reflected on a mirror. It leaves the stage after propagating through the three wave plates again in reverse order.}
    \label{fig:reflection_stage_schematic}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Polarization}
The trapping light needs to have circular polarization at the trap position in the glass cell, either with left or right helicity for both the forward and the backward pass, depending on the direction of the magnetic gradient, as explained in section~\ref{ch:mot_theory}. Since the polarization cannot be measured within the glass cell at the time of operation, the approximate configuration of the optics for attaining the necessary polarization was estimated beforehand.

In the following, the Jones vector notation for polarization in the horizontal-vertical basis $\{\KetText{H}, \KetText{V}\}$ is going to be used to denote the circular polarization states $\KetText{R}$ and $\KetText{L}$ and the diagonal polarization states $\KetText{D}$ and $\KetText{A}$:
\begin{align}
        \text{circular:} && \KetText{R} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\KetText{H} - i \KetText{V}\right),  & \KetText{L} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\KetText{H} + i \KetText{V}\right) \\
        \text{diagonal:} && \KetText{D} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\KetText{H} + \KetText{V}\right),  &  \KetText{A} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\KetText{H} - \KetText{V}\right)
\end{align}
Here, horizontal polarization $\KetText{H}$ is defined as parallel to the glass cell surface  where the beam enters the cell, vertical polarization $\KetText{V}$ is perpendicular to $\KetText{H}$. For the $y$ beams, $\KetText{V}$ is also parallel to the glass cell surface. For the $xz$ beams, $\KetText{V}$ encloses a \SI{30}{\degree} angle with the surface normal of the glass cell surface.

For the $y$ axis trap beam entering the glass cell from the left or right, the circular polarization can directly be set on the wave plates in the outcoupling stage. As the light enters the glass cell perpendicular to its surface, the polarization will not be affected when transmitted through the glass.

For the two $xz$ beams with $\xi = \SI{60}{\degree}$ between the surface normal and the beam, there is a substantial difference in power transmission for the $\KetText{H}$ and $\KetText{V}$ polarization components due to the shallow angles of incidence and because the glass cell is not anti-reflection coated. The polarization of the beams entering the glass cell therefore needs to pre-compensated by setting the wave plates on the outcoupling and the reflection stages accordingly.

\paragraph{Transmission Coefficients} The glass cell is made of fused silica with a refractive index of $n = \SI{1.456}{}$ at \SI{671}{\nano\meter} \cite{malitson_interspecimen_1965}. According to Snell's law, for the $xz$ beams the angle between the light and the surface normal in the glass is $\xi_\text{glass} = \arcsin \frac{\sin \xi}{n} = \SI{36.5}{\degree}$~\cite{demtroder_elektromagnetische_2013}. The transmission coefficients for the two polarization components are then~\cite{demtroder_elektromagnetische_2013}
\begin{align}\label{eq:fresnel}
    \begin{split}
        t_{\KetText{H}, \text{air} \rightarrow \text{glass}}(\xi, \xi_\text{glass})  &= \frac{2 \cos \xi}{\cos \xi + n \cos \xi_\text{glass}}\\
        t_{\KetText{H}, \text{glass} \rightarrow \text{air}}(\xi, \xi_\text{glass})  &= \frac{2n \cos \xi_\text{glass}}{n \cos \xi_\text{glass} + \cos \xi} \\
        t_{\KetText{V}, \text{air} \rightarrow \text{glass}}(\xi, \xi_\text{glass})  &= \frac{2 \cos \xi}{n \cos \xi + \cos \xi_\text{glass}}\\ 
        t_{\KetText{V}, \text{glass} \rightarrow \text{air}}(\xi, \xi_\text{glass})  &= \frac{2 n \cos \xi_\text{glass}}{\cos \xi_\text{glass} + \cos \xi}\\ 
    \end{split}
\end{align}
where the $\text{s}$ and $\text{p}$ components of the polarization have been mapped to the $\KetText{H}$ and $\KetText{V}$ basis vectors respectively. For the $y$ beam, they evaluate to $t_{\text{air} \rightarrow \text{glass}}(\SI{0}{\degree}, \SI{0}{\degree}) = \SI{0.814}{}$, $t_{\text{glass} \rightarrow \text{air}}(\SI{0}{\degree}, \SI{0}{\degree}) = \SI{1.186}{}$\footnote{Note that it is not unphysical if $t > 1$. The transmitted power on a surface from air to a material with $n > 1$ is $\frac{n \cos \xi_\text{transmitted}}{\cos \xi_\text{incident}}t^2$ which is always less than $1$~\cite{demtroder_elektromagnetische_2013}.}. For the $xz$ beams, they evaluate to $t_{\KetText{H}, \text{air} \rightarrow \text{glass}}(\xi, \xi_\text{glass}) = t_{\KetText{H}, \text{glass} \rightarrow \text{air}}(\xi, \xi_\text{glass}) = \SI{0.916}{}$, $t_{\KetText{V}, \text{air} \rightarrow \text{glass}}(\xi, \xi_\text{glass}) = t_{\KetText{V}, \text{glass} \rightarrow \text{air}}(\xi, \xi_\text{glass}) = \SI{0.999}{}$.

The total transmission coefficient through the \SI{4}{\milli\meter}-thick wall of the glass consists of the transmission coefficients into glass and back into air:
\begin{align}
    t_{y} &= t_{\KetText{H}, \text{air} \rightarrow \text{glass}}(\SI{0}{\degree}, \SI{0}{\degree})  \cdot t_{\KetText{H}, \text{glass} \rightarrow \text{air}}(\SI{0}{\degree}, \SI{0}{\degree}) = \SI{0.965}{} \\
    \begin{split}
        t_{xz, \KetText{H}} &= t_{\KetText{H}, \text{air} \rightarrow \text{glass}}(\xi, \xi_\text{glass})  \cdot t_{\KetText{H}, \text{glass} \rightarrow \text{air}}(\xi, \xi_\text{glass}) = \SI{0.839}{} \\
        t_{xz, \KetText{V}} &= t_{\KetText{V}, \text{air} \rightarrow \text{glass}}(\xi, \xi_\text{glass})  \cdot t_{\KetText{V}, \text{glass} \rightarrow \text{air}}(\xi, \xi_\text{glass}) = \SI{0.998}{}
    \end{split}
\end{align}

In the following, the necessary polarization adjustments of the $xz$ beams will be discussed:

\paragraph{First pass}
In order to attain circular polarization on the first pass through the glass cell, these polarization-dependent losses need to be pre-compensated when choosing the polarization before the glass cell surface:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:predicted_polarizations_first_pass}
    \Ket{\psi_{\text{before cell,} {\text{right} \atop \text{left}}}} 
    = \frac{1}{\sqrt{t_{\KetText{H}}^{-2} + t_{\KetText{V}}^{-2}}}
        \left(\frac{\KetText{H}}{t_{\KetText{H}}} \mp i \frac{\KetText{V}}{t_{\KetText{V}}} \right)
    = 0.765 \KetText{H} \mp 0.644i \KetText{V}
\end{align}

    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/first_pass_polarization_measurement_scheme/first_pass_polarization_measurement_scheme.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic of the experimental setup for verifying the polarization of the incident trapping light for the first pass through the glass cell: At first, the predicted polarizations (see equations~\ref{eq:predicted_polarizations_first_pass}) were set and verified using a polarization analyzer. Then a sample glass plate was put in and circular polarization after the plate (the ``trap'' position) was asserted with the polarization analyzer.}
    \label{fig:first_pass_polarization_measurement_scheme}
\end{figure}

For verifying these polarizations in a mock setup, a sample fused silica glass plate of thickness \SI{4.04}{\milli\meter} was placed at an angle of \SI{60}{\degree} with respect to a \SI{671}{\nano\meter} laser beam. This glass plate acts as the surface through which the light enters the glass cell. Using a quarter- and a half-wave plate, the polarization before the plate could be arbitrarily set by monitoring it on a polarization analyzer (Thorlabs PAX 1000IR). Then the glass plate was put into the beam path and and circular polarization was asserted after the glass plate, as outlined in figure~\ref{fig:first_pass_polarization_measurement_scheme}. The results are displayed in table~\ref{tab:polarization_first_pass} and show that the aforementioned estimated polarizations  are a good estimate for producing circular polarization in the glass cell.

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Results of the experimental verification of the preset polarization for the first pass through the glass cell, as outlined in figure~\ref{fig:first_pass_polarization_measurement_scheme}.

All values are outputs of a polarization analyzer (Thorlabs PAX 1000IR), transformed from the azimuth-ellpticity basis to the Jones basis as described in the appendix chapter~\ref{ch:pypol_trafos}.}
    \label{tab:polarization_first_pass}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Second pass}
In order to attain the same circular polarization on the second pass through the glass cell, the wave plates on the reflection stages must be set accordingly. Their required configuration is determined experimentally since the glass surfaces and mirrors in the beam path introduce many polarization changes that are hard to deduct from principle. Again, a mock setup with a sample glass plate at an angle of \SI[]{60}{\degree} with respect to the beam is used. This time, it acts as the surface which the light leaves and then re-enters the glass cell through.

In the mock setup, light is transmitted through a polarizing beam splitter cube and then circularly polarized using a quarter-wave plate. This light mimics the trap light before leaving the glass cell on the first pass. It is then transmitted through the sample glass plate at the shallow angle of \SI{60}{\degree}, simulating the exit from the glass cell. Afterwards the light is deflected onto a mock reflection stage, made up of a quarter-, a half-, and another quarter-wave plate, and finally onto a mirror sending the light back through the setup such that it reaches the beam splitter cube again. This arrangement is outlined in figure~\ref{fig:second_pass_waveplate_adjustment_scheme}. For the mirrors used for deflecting the beam onto the reflection stage (Laser Components 3051014), it was verified that individual mirrors all change the polarization in the same way at an incidence angle of \SI{45}{\degree}.

The ideal wave plate configuration on the reflection stage is now identified by monitoring the power reflected on the polarizing beam splitter depending on the wave plate configuration: Light passing back through the setup with the same circular polarization as on the first pass will be completely transmitted back through the beam splitter cube after traversing the quarter-wave plate in reverse direction. This means that for the desired configuration, all light of the second pass will be transmitted on the beam splitter cube, and the deflected power on the cube is minimal.

The complete evolution of polarization in the optimally configured setup for right polarization in the cell would be
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:second_pass_waveplate_adjustment_cascade_r}
    \underset{\substack{\text{beam}\\\text{splitter}}}{\longrightarrow}
    \KetText{H} 
    \underset{\substack{\text{quarter}\\\text{wave plate}}}{\longrightarrow}

    \KetText{H}
    \underset{\substack{\text{beam splitter}\\\text{port 1}}}{\longrightarrow}
\end{align}
and, analogously, for left polarization in the cell it would be
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:second_pass_waveplate_adjustment_cascade_l}
    \underset{\substack{\text{beam}\\\text{splitter}}}{\longrightarrow}
    \KetText{H}

    \underset{\substack{\text{quarter}\\\text{wave plate}}}{\longrightarrow}
    \KetText{H}
    \underset{\substack{\text{beam splitter}\\\text{port 1}}}{\longrightarrow}
\end{align}
with the polarization flip $M = \left(\begin{smallmatrix}1&0\\0&-1\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ caused by a mirror at \SI[]{0}{\degree}. The polarizations $\Ket{\psi_\text{R}}$ and $\Ket{\psi_\text{L}}$ identify the ideal wave plate configuration and are hence the observed parameter looked for in the mock setup. $\Ket{\psi_\text{R}}$ and $\Ket{\psi_\text{L}}$ can be measured by replacing the mirror with the polarization analyzer after an optical wave plate configuration has been found, as outlined in figure~\ref{fig:second_pass_waveplate_adjustment_scheme}.

The ideal polarizations were identified by finding the minima of light power on port 2 of the beam splitter ($< \SI{1}{\percent}$ of the power after the sample window). They are listed in table~\ref{tab:polarization_second_pass}.

    \label{tab:polarization_second_pass}
\end{table}

When building the trap, the polarization presets for the first and the second pass through the glass cell (tables~\ref{tab:polarization_first_pass} and ~\ref{tab:polarization_second_pass}) should be deemed an initialization point for getting a first signal. The trap then needs to be optimized by varying the polarization configuration and monitoring its loading rate with fluorescence imaging.

\subsection*{Intensity}
The intensity of the trapping light is reduced along the optical path by the reflections on the glass surfaces and scattering by the atoms in the trap. In the following, $T_{1 \rightarrow 2}(\xi_1, \xi_2) = \frac{n_2 \cos \xi_2 }{n_1 \cos \xi_2} t_{1\rightarrow 2}^2$ quantifies the power transmitted on a surface from medium $1$ to medium $2$ with beam angle $\xi_i$ in medium $i$ and a transmission coefficient of $t$~\cite{demtroder_elektromagnetische_2013}.

In the first pass, the intensity loss is due to reflections on the outer and inner surface of the glass cell wall. For the $y$ axis beam that hits the glass cell perpendicular to its surface, the remaining relative power is polarization-independent and determined by the transmission coefficient at \SI{0}{\degree} (equations ~\ref{eq:fresnel}). For the $xz$ axis beams (with polarization state $0.765 \KetText{H} \mp 0.644i \KetText{V}$, cf. equation~\ref{eq:predicted_polarizations_first_pass}), the remaining relative power is composed of the transmissions at an incidence angle $\xi = \SI{60}{\degree}$ for the two polarization components:
\begin{align}
    p_{y, \text{first pass}} = T_{y, \text{in}} &= T_{\text{air} \rightarrow \text{glass}}(\SI{0}{\degree}) T_{\text{glass} \rightarrow \text{air}}(\SI{0}{\degree}) = \left(\frac{1}{n} t^2_{\text{air} \rightarrow \text{glass}}(\SI{0}{\degree})\right) \left(n t^2_{\text{glass} \rightarrow \text{air}}(\SI{0}{\degree})\right) = \SI{0.932}{}\\
    \begin{split}
        p_{xz, \text{first pass}} = T_{xz, \text{in}} &= 0.765^2 T_{xz, \KetText{H}} + 0.644^2 T_{xz, \KetText{V}} \\
        &=  0.765^2 \left(\frac{1}{n} t^2_{\KetText{H}, \text{air} \rightarrow \text{glass}}(\xi)\right) \left(n t^2_{\KetText{H}, \text{glass} \rightarrow \text{air}}(\xi_\text{glass})\right) \\ &~~~~~+ 0.644^2 \left(\frac{1}{n} t^2_{\KetText{V}, \text{air} \rightarrow \text{glass}}(\xi)\right) \left(n t^2_{\KetText{V}, \text{glass} \rightarrow \text{air}}(\xi_\text{glass})\right) \\
        &= 0.765^2 \cdot \underbrace{0.704}_{T_{xz, \KetText{H}}} ~~+~~ 0.644^2 \cdot \underbrace{0.995}_{T_{xz, \KetText{V}}} = 0.825
    \end{split}
\end{align}

These values are corroborated by measured optical powers in a mock setup using a sample glass plate, similar to the ones for setting the polarization (figures~\ref{fig:first_pass_polarization_measurement_scheme} and~\ref{fig:second_pass_waveplate_adjustment_scheme}). The measured intensity losses are listed in table~\ref{tab:intensity_losses}.

In the second pass, the first loss $T_{\text{out}}$ is due to reflections on the two surfaces of the other glass cell wall upon exit from the glass cell. There, both beams have circular polarization before entering the glass:
\begin{align}
    T_{y, \text{out}} &= T_{y, \text{in}} = 0.932 \\
    T_{xz, \text{out}} &= \frac{1}{2} T_{xz, \KetText{H}} + \frac{1}{2} T_{xz, \KetText{V}} = 0.849
\end{align}
The second loss $T_{\text{in}}$ is due to entering the glass cell again with the same polarization as in the first pass. In addition, there are losses from scattering on the cloud of trapped atoms in the first pass which affect the available power in the second pass. Denoting the remaining relative laser power after scattering by $p_\text{scatter}$, the remaining power in the second pass compared to the first pass is
\begin{align}
    p_{y, \text{first pass} \rightarrow \text{second pass}} &= p_\text{scatter} \cdot T_{y, \text{out}} T_{y, \text{in}}   =  0.867 p_\text{scatter}\\
    p_{xz, \text{first pass} \rightarrow \text{second pass}} &= p_\text{scatter} \cdot T_{xz, \text{out}} T_{xz, \text{in}}   = 0.700 p_\text{scatter},
\end{align}
and the remaining power in the first pass compared to the original input power is
\begin{align}
    p_{y, \text{input} \rightarrow \text{second pass}} &= T_{y, \text{in}} \cdot p_\text{scatter} \cdot T_{y, \text{out}} T_{y, \text{in}} =  0.810 p_\text{scatter} \\
    p_{xz, \text{input} \rightarrow \text{second pass}} &= T_{xz, \text{in}} \cdot p_\text{scatter} \cdot T_{xz, \text{out}} T_{xz, \text{in}} = 0.578 p_\text{scatter}.
\end{align}
$p_\text{scatter}$ depends on the geometry and density of the trapped atom cloud as well as the scattering rate, which in turn depends on the laser parameters.

Table~\ref{tab:intensity_losses} lists all of these relative intensity losses.

In order to achieve a similar cooling effect in both directions for each axis, meaning the first and second pass through the glass cell, the beam diameters $d$ could be reduced in the second pass with a focusing lens or by slightly displacing the achromatic lens in the outcoupling stages such that the intensities $I \propto \frac{1}{d^2}$ are equal in both passes:
\begin{align}\label{eq:intensity_focusing}
\frac{I_\text{second pass}}{I_\text{first pass}} =  \frac{T_\text{out} T_\text{in} p_\text{scatter} / d^2_\text{second pass}}{1/ d^2_\text{first pass}} = 1 ~~\Rightarrow~~ \frac{d_\text{second pass}}{d_\text{first pass}} = \sqrt[]{T_\text{out} T_\text{in} p_\text{scatter}}
\end{align}

This would amount to $\left(\frac{d_\text{second pass}}{d_\text{first pass}}\right)_y = \SI[]{0.931}{} \cdot \sqrt{p_\text{scatter}}$ and $\left(\frac{d_\text{second pass}}{d_\text{first pass}}\right)_{xz} = \SI[]{0.837}{} \cdot \sqrt{p_\text{scatter}}$.

\subsection*{Magnetic Gradient}
The magnetic gradients for the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap are produced by the Feshbach coils placed next to the glass cell (see chapter~\ref{ch:coils}). Thanks to the high currents that are planned for the Fesh\-bach operation, the coils can generate high gradients upon reversal of the current in one of the coils. As presented in more detail in chapter~\ref{ch:field_characterization}, the maximum achievable gradients in the trapping region at full operating current are ideally \SI{99}{\gauss\per\centi\meter} in the $xz$ axis, where the recapturing axis lies, and even \SI{197}{\gauss\per\centi\meter} along the $y$ axis. Realistically, however, gradients of up to \SI{50}{\gauss\per\centi\meter} should be sufficient, which means that the setup has a comforting excess of magnetic gradient.

\subsection*{Trap Parameter Estimation}
To conclude this chapter, the properties of the geometry, the trapping light, and the magnetic gradients are used to estimate some benchmarking quantities of the projected three-dimensional magneto-optical trap.

\paragraph{Trap Dimensions}
As depicted in figure~\ref{fig:mot_extent}, the  $\frac{1}{e^2}$-diameter envelopes of the laser beams outline the trap as a rhomboid shaped region which is \SI[]{14}{\milli\meter} long in the recapturing direction (along $x$), \SI[]{8.1}{\milli\meter} long along the $z$ axis, and extends over the whole glass cell in $y$ direction.

If the reflection losses on the glass cell surface are compensated for by focusing the beam as suggested in \eqref{eq:intensity_focusing}, the beam diameter and thus also the trap size would decrease to $\SI[]{11.7}{\milli\meter}$ in $x$ direction, and $\SI[]{6.8}{\milli\meter}$ in $z$ direction, assuming negligible losses from scattering ($p_\text{scatter} \approx 1$).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/mot_extent/mot_extent.pdf}
    \caption{Extent of the trap volume set by the $\frac{1}{e^2}$-diameters of the three trap laser beams: $2\cdot \SI[]{7}{\milli\meter} = \SI[]{14}{\milli\meter}$ in $x$ direction, unbounded in $y$ direction, and $\frac{\SI[]{7}{\milli\meter}}{\cos \SI[]{30}{\degree}} = \SI[]{8.1}{\milli\meter}$ in $z$ direction. If the intensity is kept constant on the second pass through the glass cell by focusing the beam, the beam diameters would be smaller by the factor of at least \SI{0.931}{} for the $y$ beam and \SI{0.837}{} for the $xz$ beams (see equation \ref{eq:intensity_focusing}).}
    \label{fig:mot_extent}
\end{figure}

In addition to that, the atoms recaptured from the atomic beam are subject to a maximum trapping radius depending on their velocity $v$ due to the resonance condition~\eqref{eq:resonance_radius}.

\paragraph{Intensity}
Assuming optical powers of about \SI{60}{\milli\watt} for each beam of the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (D$_2$ light), as estimated in figure~\ref{fig:laser_setup_schematic}, the average intensity in a beam for the magneto-optical trap would amount to $\frac{\SI{60}{\milli\watt}}{\pi (\SI{.35}{\centi\meter})^2} = \SI{156}{\milli\watt\per\centi\meter\squared}$ which amounts to a saturation of $s_0 = 31$ for cooler and repumper respectively. Along the recapturing axis ($x$), this amounts to an effective saturation for the magneto-optical trap of
\begin{align}
    s_{0, \text{3D MOT, recapturing axis}} = 31 \cdot \cos \SI{30}{\degree} \cdot 2 = 53
\end{align}
(for the cooler and the repumper respectively), where $\cos \SI{30}{\degree}$ originates from the shallow angles of incidence and the factor of $2$ accounts for the fact that both $xz$ beams cool along the recapturing axis. This saturation is very large compared to the intensities reported for other trap implementations (cf. section~\ref{ch:3d_mots_with_li}) which means that there is a considerable excess of power for the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap in the FermiQP demonstrator.

For the gray molasses, the average intensity of the D$_1$ light would be $\frac{\SI{90}{\milli\watt}}{\pi (\SI{0.35}{\centi\meter})^2} = \SI{247}{\milli\watt\per\centi\meter\squared}$ which would amount to $s_0 = 16$ for the cooler beam.

\paragraph{Capture and Resonance Velocities}
For a trap length of \SI[]{14}{\milli\meter} and saturation $s_0 \gg 1$, so assuming a maximum scattering rate of $\Gamma \over 2$, the maximum velocity for the lithium atoms recaptured from the atomic beam can be estimated with \eqref{eq:capture_velocity_high} as:
\begin{align}
    v_\text{max, capture} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar k \Gamma \cdot \SI[]{14}{\milli\meter}}{m}} = \SI[]{90}{\meter\per\second}
\end{align}

Note that this value is the maximum ideal value for atoms entering the trap exactly along the \SI{14}{\milli\meter}-long center line through the trapping light field. Atoms that are off this line will see a shorter trap radius and thus be constrained by a lesser capture velocity, let alone the diminished light intensity there.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{pgfpicture}
        \pgftext{\input{\imagepath/resonance_velocity_map/resonance_velocity_map.pgf}}
    \end{pgfpicture}
    \caption{Estimated resonance velocity~\eqref{eq:resonance_velocity} along the recapturing axis $x$ for different detunings $\delta_\text{laser}$ and gradients $\pdv{B}{x}$ along the recapturing axis: For a fixed resonance velocity, gradient can be traded for detuning. Resonance velocities higher than the capture velocity of \SI[]{90}{\meter\per\second} are cut off (white area). Parameters: $r_\text{trap} = \SI[]{7}{\milli\meter}, \theta = \SI[]{30}{\degree}$.}
    \label{fig:resonance_velocity_map}
\end{figure}

The resonance velocity~\eqref{eq:resonance_velocity} gives the maximum velocity atoms can have such that they are still on resonance when entering the trap given a certain magnetic gradient and laser detuning $\delta_\text{laser} = \omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition}$. Atoms faster than that would require even further detuned light to be on resonance. The resonance velocity is mapped in figure~\ref{fig:resonance_velocity_map} outlining how  gradient and detuning can be traded for each other at fixed resonance velocities. E.g., for $\delta_\text{laser} = -5\Gamma$, a gradient of \SI[]{57}{\gauss\per\centi\meter} would be required to reach $v_\text{max, resonance} \approx v_\text{max, capture}$.

\paragraph{Loading Rate and Atom Number}
One can expect a loading rate in the range of \SIrange[]{e7}{e9}{} $\frac{\text{atoms}}{\si[]{\second}}$ and a number of about \SIrange{e8}{e9}{} atoms trappable in the trap, orienting on observations in other recent experiments~\cite{tiecke_high-flux_2009, chen_lithium-cesium_2021, kerkmann_novel_2019}. The actual values of the fastest loading rate and the maximum atom number will need to be experimentally determined. Apart from the parameters of the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap, they will also depend on the parameters of the two-dimensional magneto-optical trap, the push beam intensity and detuning, as well as the oven temperature. So when the setup is completed, the quest for an optimum in a high-dimensional parameter space expects the experimenters of FermiQP.
