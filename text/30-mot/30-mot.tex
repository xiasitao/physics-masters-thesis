\section{Laser Cooling with Magneto-optical Traps}
[[History (Haensch, Earnshaw), examples, Nobel Prize 1997.]]

Laser light exerting a force onto an atom is the underlying mechanism of laser cooling. There are different implementations of laser cooling, each one making use of a different way light can interact with atoms: Doppler-cooling techniques on the one hand, as e.g.\ used in magneto-optical traps, are limited by the spontaneous decay of excited states regarding the achievable temperature. Sub-Doppler-cooling techniques, on the other hand, circumvent this limit using a variety atom-light interactions, such as the optical dipole trap, Raman sideband cooling or Sisyphus cooling~\cite{foot_atomic_2005}.

The rest of this section is covering the theory of magneto-optical traps and the implementation of the 3-dimensional magneto-optical trap of the FermiQP demonstrator experiment. The explanations closely follow the respective chapters in~\cite{foot_atomic_2005} and~\cite{metcalf_laser_1999}.

\subsection*{Light scattering on atoms}
Electromagnetic waves carry momentum $\vec p = \hbar k$, which is directed into their propagation direction and depends on their wavelength $\lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k}$. When laser light scatters on atoms, a momentum transfer between the photons of the laser and the atoms takes place. The total transfer can be broken down into two parts: the absorption of laser photons where the atoms acquire momentum $\hbar \vec k$ per photon, and the spontaneous emission of photons where the atoms lose $\hbar \vec k_\text{emitted}$ per photon:
\begin{align}
    \vec p_\text{after} &= \vec p_\text{before} + \hbar \vec k + \hbar \vec k_\text{emitted}
\end{align}
The latter, however, averages to zero over many scattering events as photons are emitted into random directions. In this way, atoms loose momentum over many scattering events, if the propagation of the light and the atom movement are in opposite directions:
\begin{align}
    \Braket{\vec p_\text{after} - \vec p_\text{before}} = \Braket{\hbar \vec k} + \underbrace{\Braket{\hbar \vec k_\text{emitted}}}_{=0}
\end{align}
As visualized in figure~\ref{fig:light_scattering_momentum_transfer}, the atoms are decelerated opposite the direction of laser propagation, corresponding to cooling of the atoms.

\begin{figure}    
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/light_scattering_momentum_transfer/light_scattering_momentum_transfer.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic of momentum transfer from the laser against the atom movement direction. The momenta of the scattered photons, originating from spontaneous in random directions, averages to zero.}\label{fig:light_scattering_momentum_transfer}
\end{figure}

The rate at which this happens is determined by the fraction $\rho_{ee}$ of atoms in the excited state when light of wavelength $\omega_\text{laser}$ and intensity $I$ is shone in:
\begin{align}
    R_\text{scatter} = \Gamma \rho_{ee}
\end{align}
with the rate $\Gamma$ of spontaneous decays from the excited state into the ground state. The scattering force which corresponds to the decrease of momentum of the atoms is hence
\begin{align}
    \vec F_\text{scatter} = R_\text{scatter} \hbar \vec k = \Gamma \rho_{ee} \hbar \vec k.
\end{align}

The light-atom interaction process can be described semi-classically understanding the light as a classical electromagnetic wave, but describing the dynamics within the atom using the quantum mechanical optical Bloch equations, according to which the steady-state population of the excited state amounts to
\begin{align}
    \rho_{ee} = \frac{s_0/2}{1 + s_0 + {\left(\frac{2\delta}{\Gamma}\right)}^2},
\end{align}
with the saturation parameter $s_0 = \frac{I}{I_s} = \frac{2\Omega^2}{\Gamma^2}$, the Rabi frequency $\Omega \propto \sqrt{I}$, and the detuning $\delta$. The detuning is the deviation of the laser frequency from the transition frequency, as seen by the atom considering the Doppler shift stemming from its velocity $\vec v$ with respect to the propagation direction $\vec k$ of the laser:
\begin{align}
    \delta &= \overbrace{\omega_\text{laser} - \vec k \vec v }^\text{apparent laser frequency}- \omega_\text{transition} \\
    \nonumber & = \omega_\text{laser}  - \omega_\text{transition} - kv \cos \theta
\end{align}
with the angle $\theta$ between the atoms' velocity and the propagation direction of the light.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \caption{Scattering force as a function of speed against the laser direction for different values of the detuning $\delta_\text{laser}$.}\label{fig:scattering_force_vs_velocity}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:scattering_force_vs_velocity} shows how the scattering force depends on the velocity of the atoms. The force is maximal for velocities where Doppler shift $\vec k \vec v$ cancels out the laser detuning $\delta_\text{laser} = \omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition}$. Deceleration of atoms happens with red laser detuning $\delta_\text{laser} < 0$ as the light is resonant for atoms moving against the laser propagation direction. These atoms sense the light scattering force against their direction of movement; atoms moving in the other direction do not sense the scattering force (see figure~\ref{fig:scattering_force_detuning}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/scattering_force_detuning/scattering_force_detuning.pdf}
    \caption{Atoms moving against the direction of laser propagation see the laser light blue-shifted, atoms moving in the other direction see it red-shifted. For negative laser detuning ($\delta_\text{laser} < 0$) the former sense the light as it is close to resonance, the latter do not sense it as it is far detuned for them.}\label{fig:scattering_force_detuning}
\end{figure}

\paragraph*{Doppler limit} While the momentum gained by spontaneous emission of photons averages to zero, the square of momentum $\vec p_\text{after decay}^2$ gained from the spontaneous decays does not. This means that the atom is always left with a finite amount of kinetic energy from the recoil of emitted photons. The magnitude of this leftover energy is related to the decay rate $\Gamma$ and is called the Doppler limit:
\begin{align}
    k_B T_D = \frac{\hbar \Gamma}{2}
\end{align}
Laser cooling techniques using spontaneous emission of photons, by principle, cannot provide cooling below this limit (neglecting any coincidental sub-Doppler cooling effects)~\cite{foot_atomic_2005}.


\subsection*{Magneto-optical Traps}
Magneto-optical traps use light scattering on atoms in order to cool and spatially confine atoms. They have become a standard tool in ultracold neutral atom experiments over the last decades.

\paragraph{Optical molasses} Magneto-optical traps make use of the optical molasses technique for slowing down atoms. As discussed above, light scattering provides a decelerating force opposite the direction of laser beams for red detuning. By using three pairs of counter-propagating laser beams, one pair in each spatial degree of freedom, atoms are decelerated in each direction. For an atom of speed $v \ll \frac{\Gamma}{k}$, travelling at an angle $\theta$ with respect to the  counter-propagating beams with wave number $k$, the scattering force in this direction can be linearized as as friction force
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        F &= F(\omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition} - kv \cos \theta) - F(\omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition} + kv \cos \theta) \\
        &\approx - 2 \pdv{F}{\omega} k v \cos \theta \equiv -\alpha v \cos \theta
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
with damping $\alpha = 2k \pdv{F}{\omega}$\footnote{For $s_0 \ll 1$, the damping coefficient can be approximated as $\alpha  = 4 \hbar k^2 s_0 \frac{-2d/\Gamma}{{\left(1+{{(2\delta/\Gamma)}}^2\right)}^2}$~\cite{foot_atomic_2005}.}~\cite{foot_atomic_2005}. The velocity-dependence of the optical molasses deceleration force is depicted in figure~\ref{fig:optical_molasses_force}.

\begin{figure}
    \caption{Scattering force in optical molasses as a function of velocity. Due to the Doppler shift, only fast atoms (close to resonance) sense the scattering force. Here, the detuning was set to $\delta = -\Gamma/2$.}\label{fig:optical_molasses_force}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Spatial confinement} For spatial confinement of atoms the Zeeman effect is exploited which shifts the energy levels of magnetic sublevels of spin or orbital angular momentum states under the influence of an external magnetic field. This energy shift with respect to a situation without a magnetic field, where the magnetic sublevels are degenerate, amounts to
\begin{align}
    \Delta E(m) = g \mu_B m B
\end{align}
with the LandÃ© factor $g$, the Bohr magneton $\mu_B$, the magnetic field $B$ and the magnetic quantum number $m$. Applying a magnetic gradient, the transition frequencies between two magnetic sublevels $m$ and $m'$ becomes position-dependent:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}\label{eq:omega_transition_zeeman}
      \omega_\text{transition}(r) &= \omega_\text{transition} + \frac{\Delta E(r)}{\hbar} \\  
      &= \omega_\text{transition} + \frac{g \mu_B}{\hbar} \dv{B}{r} \equiv \omega_\text{transition} + \beta r
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Hence also the detuning between the laser light and the driven transition becomes position-dependent which allows for spatially varying scattering forces.

In order to create a confining trap, laser beams and magnetic gradients are calibrated such that the atoms sense restoring forces towards a center point when they move away from there. This means that on opposite sides of the trap, these restoring forces must point in opposite directions. One achieves this by clever use of the magnetic gradient and the polarization-dependent selection rules for transitions between magnetic sublevels, as visualized in figures~\ref{fig:restoring_on_opposite_sides_schematic} and~\ref{fig:detuning_and_selection_rules_schematic}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Due to the magnetic gradient, the magnetic field has different sign on opposite sides of the trap center, hence also the Zeeman shifts $\Delta E$ have different sign for the transitions $\Delta m = +1$ and $\Delta m = -1$. This also means that on each side only one of these transitions is close to resonance with the laser light.
    \item $\sigma^+$ light (light with right helicity with respect to the atoms' quantization axis) can only drive transitions with $\Delta m = +1$, $\sigma^-$ light (left helicity) can only drive transitions with $\Delta m = -1$. In each pair of counter-propagating beams, one of the beams has $\sigma^+$ and one has $\sigma^-$ polarization, such that on each side the atoms only see the beam propagating towards the trap center.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/restoring_on_opposite_sides_schematic/restoring_on_opposite_sides_schematic.pdf}
    \caption{Two-dimensional schematic of creation of restoring forces: Due to the magnetic gradient and the Zeeman effect, on each side of the trap, different transitions between magnetic sublevels are on resonance. Assigning different helicity of circular polarization to counter-propagating lasers, atoms only sense a scattering force in the direction of the trap center.}\label{fig:restoring_on_opposite_sides_schematic}
\end{figure} 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/detuning_and_selection_rules_schematic/detuning_and_selection_rules_schematic.pdf}
    \caption{One-dimensional schematic of selection rules and detunings of the laser beams: On both sides of the trap different transitions between magnetic sublevels are resonant. Due to the polarization-dependent selection rules, only one of the two counter-propagating beams is resonant on each side of the trap.}\label{fig:detuning_and_selection_rules_schematic}
\end{figure}

Note that the helicity of the polarization is given with respect to the (arbitrary, but fixed) quantization axis of the atoms. As the laser beams in each pair counter-propagate, one of them points to in and one against the quantization axis. The circular polarization with respect to their respective propagation direction is hence the same for both laser beams in a pair (both $\sigma^+$ or both $\sigma^-$, depending on the gradient field).


Similarly to the optical molasses consideration, in the magneto-optical trap the scattering forces can be linearized [[under which condition?]] (here again for one dimension)~\cite{foot_atomic_2005}:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        F_\text{MOT} &= F_{\sigma^+}(\omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition}(r) - kv \cos \theta) + F_{\sigma^-}(\omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition}(r) + kv \cos \theta)\\
        &= -2 \pdv{F}{\omega} k\cos \theta v + 2 \pdv{F}{\omega_0} \beta r  \equiv - \alpha \cos \theta v - \frac{\alpha \beta}{k} r
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
This shows how a magneto-optical trap combines the friction force $- \alpha v$ for slowing down atoms and the trapping force $- \frac{\alpha \beta}{k} z$ confining the atoms to a trap center.

[maybe add 3D plot with v, z, F axes]

\paragraph{Characteristic quantities}
Important technical quantities that need to be adjusted for optimizing the performance of a MOT include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item laser intensities $I_\text{cooler}$ and $I_\text{repumper}$
    \item laser detunings with respect to the transition wavelength $\delta_\text{cooler}$ and $\delta_\text{repumper}$
    \item the angle $\theta$ of the atomic beam with respect to the cooling laser beams
    \item magnetic gradient $\pdv{B}{r}$
\end{itemize}

These quantities might also be varied over one trapping cycle, e.g. for compressing the trap and cooling the atoms further down by decreasing the laser intensity and the laser detuning and increasing the magnetic gradient.

The magneto-optical trap can be benchmarked by, among others, the following quantities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The radius $r_\text{max}$ of the trapping region where the atoms are slowed  is on the order of the size of the trapping beams: $r_\text{max} \approx w$. The trap size is also limited by the distance $r_\text{resonance}$ from the trap center where the trapping beams become resonant due to the Zeeman shift (cf. equation \ref{eq:omega_transition_zeeman}): $\omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition} - \vec k \vec v = \frac{g \mu_B}{\hbar} \pdv{B}{r} r_\text{resonance}$. At larger distances from the trap, the trapping light is blue detuned and thus accelerating, hence slowing of atoms only occurs within a distance of $r_\text{resonance}$. In a one-dimensional consideration, one can deduce a maximum speed at which atoms entering the trap can still be on resonance~\cite{tiecke_high-flux_2009}:
    \begin{align}
        v_\text{max} = \frac{1}{k \cos \theta}\left(\omega_\text{laser} - \omega_\text{transition} - \frac{g \mu_B}{\hbar} \pdv{B}{r} r_\text{resonance}\right)
    \end{align}
    Given that the slowing force is large, one can assume that, on the way towards the trap center, the atoms are kept on resonance with the (due to the magnetic gradient) ever less detuned trapping light. In this case, $v_\text{max}$ can be used to estimate the capture velocity of the trap~\cite{tiecke_high-flux_2009}.
    \item The loading rate characterizes how many atoms can be trapped per time unit. It depends on the trap geometry, the flux rate and the velocity distribution of the incoming atoms, the applied gradients, laser powers, detunings of the cooling and repumping light, collisions among the trapped atoms, and many more. Due to these complex dependencies, the loading rate needs to be characterized experimentally.
    \item The temperature of the atoms in the trap. It usually in the order of magnitude above the Doppler temperature $T_D$ [[cite]].
    \item Regarding the trap as a harmonic oscillator, one can quantify the atom oscillation frequency $\omega_\text{MOT} = \frac{\alpha}{m}$, oscillation damping rate $\Gamma_\text{MOT} = \sqrt{\frac{\alpha \beta}{km}}$, and atom trap restoring time $t_\text{restore} = \frac{2\Gamma_\text{MOT}}{\omega_\text{MOT}^2}$ with atom mass $m$~\cite{metcalf_laser_1999}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Relevant transitions in alkali atoms}
\sloppy For cooling alkali atoms in a magneto-optical trap, transitions between electronic levels $J_\text{g}$ and $J_\text{g} + 1$ are used. The cooling transition can be imple\-mented between hyperfine states $\KetSpaced{J = J_\text{g}, F = I + J_\text{g}}$ (the highest $F$ in the $J_\text{g}$ manifold), and $\KetSpaced{J = J_\text{g} + 1, F= I + J_\text{g} + 1}$. This ensures that all decays bring the atom down into the original $\KetSpaced{J = J_\text{g}, F = I + J_\text{g}}$ state due to the selection rule $\Delta F \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$.

If, however, the atom is excited into the $\KetSpaced{J = J_\text{e}, F = F_\text{g}}$ state due to a non-zero matrix element for this transition, it can also fall back into the $\KetSpaced{J = J_\text{e}, F = I + J_\text{g} - 1}$ state. In this case, it would not be subject to cooling anymore as this state is dark to the cooling transition. To combat this, a repumper laser beam is shone in in addition to the cooler beam. This beam addresses the transition $\KetSpaced{J = J_\text{g}, F = I + J_\text{g} - 1} \rightarrow \KetSpaced{J = J_\text{g} + 1, F = I + J_\text{g}}$ from where they can decay back into the ground state of the cooling transition which brings them back into the cooling cycle~\cite{metcalf_laser_1999}.

These cooling and repumping cascades are summarized in equations~\eqref{eq:cooler_cascade} and~\eqref{eq:repumper_cascade}:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:cooler_cascade}\text{cooler:}~~~~~ & \KetSpaced{J_\text{g},I + J_\text{g}} \underset{\text{cooler}}{\longrightarrow} \KetSpaced{J_\text{g} + 1, I + J_\text{g} + 1} \rightsquigarrow  \KetSpaced{J_\text{g}, I + J_\text{g}}\\
    \label{eq:repumper_cascade}\text{repumper:}~~~~~ & \KetSpaced{J_\text{g} + 1, I + J_\text{g}} \rightsquigarrow \KetSpaced{J_\text{g}, I + J_\text{g} - 1}  \underset{\text{repumper}}{\longrightarrow} \KetSpaced{J_\text{g} + 1, I + J_\text{g}} \rightsquigarrow  \KetSpaced{J_\text{g}, I + J_\text{g}}
\end{align}

\section{Magneto-optical Traps with Lithium}
3-dimensional magneto-optical traps for lithium usually operate on the D$_2$ line, i.e.~between the $^2S_{1/2}$ and $^2P_{3/2}$ manifolds, as in the implementation in the FermiQP demonstrator. Since the first implementation with lithium in the early 1990s \cite{kawanaka_decay_1993}, they have become a standard part of ultracold lithium experiments, namely for experiments with fermionic~\cite{duarte_all-optical_2011,omran_microscopic_2015} and bosonic~\cite{kawanaka_decay_1993,schunemann_magneto-optic_1998} lithium as well as for isotope mixtures \cite{mewes_simultaneous_1999, hilker_laser_2012,kerkmann_novel_2019} and species mixtures \cite{ladouceur_compact_2009,tiecke_high-flux_2009,chen_lithium-cesium_2021}.

For D$_2$ line traps for fermionic lithium, the energy splitting between the two ground state hyperfine manifolds $\KetSpaced{J=1/2, F=1/2}$ and $\KetSpaced{J=1/2, F=3/2}$ is \SI{228}{\mega\hertz}, which sets the difference in frequency for the cooler and repumper laser beams. It is important to note that the hyperfine levels $F = \frac{5}{2}$, $\frac{3}{2}$, and $\frac{1}{2}$ of the excited state cannot be resolved because the D$_2$ line is broader than the splitting between these hyperfine states. This implies that it cannot be controlled which hyperfine state the cooler excites the atoms into. A large fraction of them will hence drop into the $\KetSpaced{J=1/2, F=1/2}$ state and need to be repumped. For this reason, the cooler and repumper have equal importance in a Lithium magneto-optical trap. Another implication is that coincidental sub-Doppler cooling, as observed in magneto-optical traps for other atomic species, cannot be expected to support the cooling process~\cite{grier_lambda-enhanced_2013}.

Typical parameter ranges for 3-dimensional traps with lithium from earlier experiments are~\cite{
    tiecke_high-flux_2009,
    kawanaka_decay_1993,
    schunemann_magneto-optic_1998,
    mewes_simultaneous_1999,
    hilker_laser_2012,
    kerkmann_novel_2019,
    ladouceur_compact_2009,
    chen_lithium-cesium_2021,    
    burchianti_efficient_2014,
    li_enhanced_2015,
}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item laser intensities: from a few up to more than ten saturation intensities, with a little less power on the repumper
    \item beam diameter: \SI{5}{\milli\meter} to \SI{15}{\milli\meter}
    \item detuning: up to $-10 \Gamma$, with the repumper often being less detuned than the cooler
    \item magnetic gradients: \SI{10}{\gauss\per\centi\meter} to \SI{50}{\gauss\per\centi\meter}
    \item achieved temperature: on the order of \SI{1e-3}{\kelvin} to \SI{3e-4}{\kelvin}
    \item atom number: around \SI{1e7}{} to \SI{1e8}{}
\end{itemize}

Lower temperatures than in magneto-optical traps operating on the D$_2$ line have been reached by using a UV transition~\cite{duarte_all-optical_2011,omran_microscopic_2015} which, however, requires expensive laser sources optical components~\cite{burchianti_efficient_2014}. More efficient loading rates have been achieved in a magneto-optical traps by adding sidebands onto the cooling light in order to address more velocity classes~\cite{li_enhanced_2015}.

\end{figure}

\section{Gray Molasses Cooling}
The subsequent step in the cooling cycle in the FermiQP demonstrator, after the 3-dimensional magneto-optical trap, will be gray molasses cooling~\cite{grynberg_proposal_1994,weidemuller_novel_1994}. This sub-Doppler cooling technique operates on the D$_1$ line of lithium, i.e. the $^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow {^2P_{1/2}}$ transition~\cite{burchianti_efficient_2014}.

Gray molasses is based on atoms moving in a polarization-gradient field where they move up a potential hill until they decay into a lower energy state, similar to Sisyphus cooling~\cite{foot_atomic_2005}. Gray molasses operates on $\Delta J = 0$ transitions, as is the case for the D$_1$ line. This transition functions as a $\Lambda$ system with the two ground states being the states $\Ket{\text{ground}, m}$ and $\Ket{\text{ground}, m + 2}$ and the excited state being $\Ket{\text{excited}, m + 1}$~\cite{weidemuller_novel_1994}, as illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:gray_molasses_level_diagram}. Coupling between these states is polarization-dependent due to dipole selection rules.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{\imagepath/gray_molasses_level_diagram/gray_molasses_level_diagram.pdf}
    \caption{Level diagram of the D$_1$ line of lithium. The $\Lambda$-system used in gray molasses cooling consists of two manifolds with equal $J$, made up of two magnetic sublevels in the ground state and one in the excited state.}\label{fig:gray_molasses_level_diagram}
\end{figure}

The counter-propagating gray molasses beams have circular polarization. At every point the superposition of the polarizations yields an effective polarization that is sensed by the atoms. This effective polarization depends on the phase of the two light beams with respect of each other, that means that the atoms see alternating circular, elliptical, linear, elliptical, etc. polarization along their journey through the light field. This makes the coupling between the relevant states position-dependent, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:gray_molasses_polarization_gradient}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{\imagepath/gray_molasses_polarization_gradient/gray_molasses_polarization_gradient.pdf}
    \caption{Polarization-gradient in the gray molasses scheme: Atoms move along the light field and see different energy shifts depending on their position. At positions with low light shift, they transition from the dark state $\Ket{\text{D}}$ to the coupling state $\Ket{\text{C}}$ and move further losing kinetic energy in the polarization gradient field until they decay back.}\label{fig:gray_molasses_polarization_gradient}
\end{figure}

In the gray molasses' light field, the $\Lambda$-system is dressed with two orthogonal, hence not mutually coupling, eigenstates $\Ket{\text{C}}$ and $\Ket{\text{D}}$, being superpositions of the two ground states. One of them, $\Ket{\text{C}}$, couples to the light field via the excited state and experiences an energy shift $E_C \propto \frac{\Omega_\text{eff}^2}{\delta}$. The other, $\Ket{\text{D}}$, is a dark state~\cite{weidemuller_novel_1994,gerken_gray_2016}.

The absence of coupling between these two states only persists as long as the atoms' kinetic energy is not considered. For atoms with momentum $p$, there is a non-zero transition probability $P \propto \left|\frac{p}{E_C} \right|^2$~\cite{weidemuller_novel_1994}. This means that faster atoms are more prone to transition from the dark state to the coupling state, and that this transition is most likely in areas with low light intensity.

The cooling effect in this scheme can now be understood as follows: Atoms move along the gray molasses light field with a finite velocity $v$. At points with low light intensity, due to the polarization gradient, they are likely to transition from the dark state $\Ket{\text{D}}$ to the coupling state $\Ket{\text{C}}$. Moving further in the polarization-gradient field, their light shift energy $E_C$ increases, at the cost of their kinetic energy. When they spontaneously decay back into the dark state $\Ket{\text{D}}$ they lose an amount of energy on the order of the light shift $E_C$. This is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:gray_molasses_polarization_gradient}. The gray molasses light needs to be blue detuned, $\delta > 0$, because then the light shift is positive, and the atoms lose energy falling back into the dark state $\Ket{\text{D}}$. With this scheme,  temperatures even below the recoil limit $T_\text{recoil}$ can be reached~\cite{weidemuller_novel_1994,gerken_gray_2016}.


\paragraph{Gray Molasses with Lithium} The D$_1$ line of lithium is just \SI{10}{\giga\hertz} off the D$_2$ line. This avoids the need for separate laser system in a different wavelength regime and  enables reusing optics of the magneto-optical trap for the gray molasses. Similar to the magneto-optical trap, a cooler and a repumper are needed: the former is blue detuned with respect to the $\Ket{^2S_{1/2}, F = 3/2} \rightarrow \Ket{^2P_{1/2}, F = 3/2}$ transition, the latter is blue detuned with respect to the $\Ket{^2S_{1/2}, F = 1/2} \rightarrow \Ket{^2P_{1/2}, F = 3/2}$. In contrast to cooling on the D$_2$ line, the excited manifold of the D$_1$ line is resolved, meaning the splitting between its excited state's hyperfine level is larger than its line width~\cite{gerken_gray_2016}.

\citeauthor{burchianti_efficient_2014} implemented gray molasses for fermionic lithium in 2014. Their parameters were taken as a reference starting point for configuring the gray molasses of the FermiQP demonstrator setup~\cite{burchianti_efficient_2014}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item laser intensities: $s_{0, \text{cooler}} = 2.7$, $\frac{I_\text{repumper}}{I_\text{cooler}} \approx 0.2$
    \item detunings: $\delta_\text{cooler} = +5.4 \Gamma$, varying $\delta_\text{repumper}$ between $(\delta_\text{cooler} -2 \Gamma)$ and  $(\delta_\text{cooler}+ 3\Gamma)$
\end{itemize}
with $I_s = \SI{7.59}{\milli\watt\per\square\centi\meter}$ and $\Gamma = \SI{5.8724}{\mega\hertz}$ for the D$_1$ line~\cite{gehm_properties_2003}.


\section{The 3-dimensional Magneto-optical Trap of the FermiQP Demonstrator}
In this section, the geometry, the laser setup, the optics and the magnetic gradients for the 3-dimensional magneto-optical trap in the FermiQP demonstrator will be discussed. Due to massive supply chain problems and delivery time extensions by part vendors, only the laser setup [[and optics]] could be built during the writing of the thesis. For the other aspects of the trap, details of planning and simulations are presented.

\subsection*{Geometry}
The 3-dimensional magneto-optical trap of the FermiQP demonstrator is loaded from the atomic beam originating from the 2-dimensional magneto-optical trap. It is guided through a differential pumping stage separating the high and the ultra-high vacuum regions of the experiment chamber. The trap is located in the front part of the glass cell. The space around the glass cell is tightly packed with the two microscope objectives sitting above and below the trap and the Feshbach coils placed left and right of the incoming atomic beam, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:glass_cell_vicinity}. As a reminder, the reference coordinate system of the experiment chamber is that $x$ is along the atomic beam, $y$ is to the left as seen in the direction of the atomic beam, and $z$ is in upward direction.

\end{figure}

The magneto-optical trap needs three pairs of beams, one for each spatial degree of freedom that the atoms should be cooled along. For each pair, a beam is shot in from one side and retroreflected after passing through the glass cell. Due to the tightly packed vicinity of the glass cell, the beam axes cannot match with the Cartesian coordinate axes: no beams can be shot along the $z$ axis which is blocked by the objectives, and no beam can be shot directly along the atomic beam axis ($x$) because no retroreflection would be possible on the other side of the glass cell.

Instead, two beams are shone in in the $xz$ plane at an angle with respect to the atomic beam. The geometry of the microscope objectives only permits shooting beams into the glass cell at shallow angles, namely with an incidence angle of \SI{60}{\degree} with respect to the surface normal of the glass cell, as depicted in figure~\ref{fig:glass_cell_sides_mot_beams_0}. These beams provide cooling and confinement along the atomic beam axis ($x$, with an angle $\theta = \SI{30}{\degree}$ between light propagation $\vec k$ and velocity $\vec v$ of the atomic beam) and the up-down axis ($y$). The third beam is shot in along the $y$ axis, i.e.\ from left to right (see figure~\ref{fig:glass_cell_sides_mot_beams_1}).

\subsection*{Cooling Laser Setup}
The cooling laser beams for the 2-dimensional and the 3-dimensional magneto-optical traps as well as for the gray molasses are jointly produced on an optics board from where they are transferred to the experiment chamber via optical fibers.

The laser beams originate from two laser sources, one for D$_2$ light for the magneto-optical traps and one for D$_1$ light for the gray molasses. All beams produced by the setup consist of cooler and repumper light, which is separated by \SI{228}{\mega\hertz}, the hyperfine splitting of the $^2S_{1/2}$ ground state. For the 2-dimensional magneto-optical trap, the frequencies of the cooler and repumper light as well as their powers are fixed, for the 3-dimensional trap and the gray molasses light they need to be variable in order to compress and optimize the traps dynamically. The light for the 3-dimensional trap and the gray molasses cooling should be prepared on the same optical path, which is useful as both cooling schemes are carried out at the same position in the experiment chamber. All beams need to have high enough powers such that several saturation intensities on the respective trap cross sections (\SI{30}{\milli\meter} for the 2-dimensional trap and \SI{7}{\milli\meter} for the 3-dimensional trap and the gray molasses cooling).

\paragraph{Laser sources} The \SI{671}{\nano\meter} laser light for the D$_2$ and D$_1$ lines is jointly produced for all aforementioned cooling beams by two Raman fiber amplifiers (MPB [[model name]], "Socrates" and "Plato") with a specified output power of \SI{1.5}{\watt} each. They are supplied with seed light by two XYZ lasers (Toptica [[model name]], "Zeno" and "Heraklitus"), delivering around \SI{20}{\milli\watt} of power. These seeds are offset-locked to a global reference laser that itself is locked to an ultra-low expansion cavity. The offset locking allows shifting the laser frequencies of the D$_2$ and the D$_1$ light arbitrarily within a range of a few \si{\mega\hertz} [[TODO verify]]. The interplay of these lasers is outlined in figure~\ref{fig:laser_interplay_schematic}.

\begin{figure}
    \caption{Schematic of the cooling laser setup: Two Raman fiber amplifiers provide light for the optics setups that prepare the light used in the magneto-optical traps and the gray molasses. The amplifiers are offset-locked via their seeds to a global reference lasers which, in turn, is locked to a reference cavity.}\label{fig:laser_interplay_schematic}
\end{figure}


The main advantage of using the Raman fiber amplifiers is that they produce enough optical power to simultaneously supply all three aforementioned traps with light. An alternative would be separate laser sources, each of which would need to be frequency-locked and monitored independently. During the writing of the thesis, the Raman fiber amplifiers showed signs of substantial degradation as their output power decreased by over \SI{20}{\percent} in only a few weeks of intermittent operation. The details and the severity of this degradation are presented in~\cite{qesja_design_2022}. As the experimenters of FermiQP, as well as the manufacturers, could not come up with a quick and reliable solution to this problem, it stays uncertain whether the Raman fiber amplifiers can be used long-term for the laser cooling within the FermiQP demonstrator. An alternative approach would be amplification of the seed light using tapered amplifier chips.

    For the light for the 2-dimensional trap, a small amount of power is taken out for the push beam (B) before it is split into cooler and repumper (C) light for the two outputs. This part of the laser setup was constructed within the scope of this thesis.
    The light for the 3-dimensional trap and the D$_1$ light for the gray molasses are spatially overlapped (D), split into cooler and repumper (E), and then distributed into three outputs (F).
