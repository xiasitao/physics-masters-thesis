\chapter{Feshbach and Gradient Field Coils}\label{ch:coils}
This chapter treats of the coils used for generating homogeneous magnetic fields for tuning Feshbach resonances and for creating magnetic gradients for the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap: First, it is outlined which requirements and constraints these coils are subject to in the experiment. Then a Python library developed for simulating magnetic fields and operational properties of coil arrangements is presented. Afterwards, the coils and the magnetic fields are characterized with measurements and simulations. In this chapter, these coils are called \textit{Feshbach coils}.

\section{Requirements and Constraints}
The FermiQP demonstrator setup and its planned experimental operations impose certain requirements and constraints on the fields as well as the design  and the geometry of the Feshbach coils:

\subsection*{Magnetic Field Strength}
The Feshbach coils serve two main purposes: On the one hand, they produce strong homogeneous magnetic fields, e.g. for scanning over the Feshbach resonance of lithium at \SI{834}{\gauss} and thereby tuning on-site interactions in the Fermi-Hubbard model, as described in chapter~\ref{ch:analog_mode}. On the other hand, they provide magnetic gradients up to the order of \SI[]{e2}{\gauss\per\centi\meter} for the three-dimensional magneto optical trap. A value of \SI{1300}{\gauss} was set as the target field magnitude in the homogeneous mode, created at a current of $I = \SI{400}{\ampere}$ provided by two high-current power supplies for each coil\footnote{Delta Elektronika SM 15-400 with a maximum output power of \SI[]{6}{\kilo\watt}, voltage up to \SI[]{15}{\volt}, and current up to \SI[]{400}{\ampere}}.

In order to generate flat homogeneous fields, the coils are arranged in Helmholtz configuration, meaning that two equally-sized circular coils are placed on a common axis such that their distance is equal to their radius.\footnote{In the rest of this chapter, the term \textit{Helmholtz configuration} will refer to two coils of the same size sharing the same axis at a distance equal to their radii. All coil arrangements discussed in this chapter will be in Helmholtz configuration. If the current in both coils flows in the same direction, meaning that the coils generate a homogeneous field between them, the operation mode will be referred to as \textit{homogeneous field mode}. If, however, the current flows in opposite directions such that the coils generate a field gradient between them, the operation mode will be referred to as \textit{gradient mode}. Note that, similar to the $d = r$ condition of the Helmholtz configuration, there is a different optimal configuration for gradient fields, often called \textit{anti-Helmholtz configuration}, which however requires a different distance $d \neq r$ and does not occur in this chapter.} The effective optimal ratio of distance and radius required, however, depends on the finite size and the actual geometry of the coils.

\subsection*{Geometry}
In order to produce these strong fields with reasonable currents, the radius of the coils should be kept as small as possible, and they should be placed as close to the glass cell as possible.

The coils will enclose the two objectives above and below the glass cell between them. This introduces a minimum distance of around \SI{50}{\milli\meter} between the coils still allowing a few \si[]{\milli\meter} of leeway to fit the objectives between the coils. It was decided for a distance of \SI{55}{\milli\meter} between the innermost wires of the coils, not considering additional surface material on the coils. These geometrical constraints led to the estimation that 30 windings are needed to attain the required \SI{1300}{\gauss} of field\footnote{Estimated using simulations  as outlined in sections~\ref{ch:simulation} and~\ref{ch:coil_properties}}.

The orientation of the coil arrangement is constrained by the requirement that Raman transitions on the atoms in the optical lattice be driven with $\pi$-polarized light shone in through the objectives. As this light propagates along the $z$ axis, its polarization vector lies in the $xy$ plane. Since $\pi$ transitions can only be driven if the polarization vector and the quantization axis are parallel, the direction of the magnetic field and hence also the coil axis are constrained to the $xy$ plane. It was decided to align the coil arrangement with the $y$ axis, meaning that the two coils sit on the left and on the right of the glass cell with the coil axis passing through the trap region of the magneto-optical trap.

Figure~\ref{fig:feshbach_coil_geometry_constraints} shows the geometrical constraints on the positioning of the coils.

\begin{figure}

    \caption{Position of the Feshbach coils with respect to the glass cell and the objectives: The objectives (\SI{44}{\milli\meter} diameter) which are positioned below and above the glass cell are enclosed by the two coils, setting the minimum distance between the coils. The innermost coil wires have a distance of \SI{55}{\milli\meter}.}
    \label{fig:feshbach_coil_geometry_constraints}
\end{figure}

Since the coils have many windings and so also a significant size, they block a non-negligible part of the optical access to the location of the atoms in the glass cell. Many laser beams and imaging signals must be shot into and received from the glass cell, demanding that the coils leave open as much solid angle as possible. Most notably, the pinning lattice beams enter through the long surfaces on the left and right with incidence angles of $\pm \SI{45}{\degree}$, the science lattice beams enter with incidence angles of around $\pm \SI{15}{\degree}$ on the short sides of the glass cell bounding the available space for the coils. In order to minimize the blocked optical access, a cone-like coil geometry with a parallelogram-shaped cross-section consisting of $6 \times 5$ windings was opted for, as depicted in figure~\ref{fig:parallelogram_cross_section}. The opening angle of the cone has been set to $\SI{45}{\degree}$ because then the Helmholtz condition is approximately fulfilled for every layer.

    \label{fig:parallelogram_cross_section}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Field and Temperature Stability}
The FermiQP demonstrator aims for a relative field stability of \SI{e-7}{} calling for an active stabilization mechanism. For this purpose, both coils are independently driven by separate power supplies supporting fast current switching.

Furthermore, it is important to ensure thermal stability of the coils. The electrical power $P(I) = RI^2$ dissipated in the coils with resistance $R$ shows quadratic scaling  with the driving current $I$. For an exemplary coil with \SI{10}{\milli\ohm} resistance driven with $I = \SI{400}{\ampere}$ this would amount to a dissipated power of \SI{1.6}{\kilo\watt} converted into heat. In order to transport this heat off efficiently, avoiding a critical increase of temperature, the coils need to feature hollow-core wires for water cooling. For a given maximal temperature increase $\Delta T$ of the cooling water, the cooling power of the water can be estimated as $Q_\text{cool} = c_\text{water} ~ \Delta T ~ m_\text{water} ~ v_\text{flow}$ with the heat capacity $ c_\text{water}$ of water, the specific mass $m_\text{water}$ of the water in the hollow-core wire, and the speed $v_\text{flow}$ of the cooling water flow, which depends on the applied pressure, the turbulence of the flow, and the wire geometry.

To lower the required cooling water pressure and to avoid turbulences in the cooling water stream, it was decided to separate the six wire layers into three pancakes of two layers each, constituting three separately driven water cooling circuits, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:pancake_structure}. The two supply lines for each pancake are placed next to each other, forming pairs of wires with current flowing in opposite directions. This has the additional advantage that the fields of the supply lines cancel out in the far-field and do not influence the magnetic field in the center of the coil arrangement.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/pancake_structure/pancake_structure.pdf}
    \caption{Cross-section of the pancake structure of the coils: Two layers of wire are combined into a so-called pancake that constitutes a single water cooling circuit. The layers have layer jump on the innermost winding where the wire hops from one layer to the other. The current in the two supply lines for each pancake is flowing in opposite directions such that the magnetic fields originating from the wire cancel out in the far-field.}
    \label{fig:pancake_structure}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Field Curvature}\label{ch:field_curvature_definition}
When the atoms trapped in glass cell are exposed to the homogeneous magnetic field, they experience an energy shift resulting from the interaction of their magnetic moment $\vec \mu$ with the field $\vec B$ which can lead to trapping or anti-trapping effects~\cite{pritchard_cooling_1983,gehm_properties_2003, hagemann_setup_2020}:
\begin{align}
    E_{B, {\text{high-field seeker} \atop \text{low-field seeker}}} = \mp \vec \mu \vec B
\end{align}
where the sign of the shift depends on whether the atoms are in high- or low-field seeking states. The magnitude of the magnetic moment is $\mu \approx \mu_\text{B}$ with the Bohr magneton $\mu_\text{B} = \SI{9.27e-24}{\joule\per\tesla}$.

In the very center of the coil arrangement, the magnetic field is completely homogeneous in case of optimally positioned coils. Realistically, however, there is a non-negligible position dependence $B(\vec r)$ of the field, stemming from the finite size of the region of interest and imperfections in positioning, aligning, and manufacturing of the coils. This leads to a potential landscape that the atoms are exposed to such that their Hamiltonian reads:
\begin{align}
    \hat H(\vec r) = \frac{\vec p^2}{2m} \mp \vec \mu_\text{B} \vec B(\vec r)
\end{align}

Assuming that the magnetic field around the center of the coil arrangement in one dimension follows a paraboloid shape, modelled as $B(q) = B_0 + a_{\vec q} q^2$ with a field curvature coefficient $a$ and a spatial coordinate $q$, one can equate the magnetic potential with that of a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator:
\begin{align}
    \underbrace{V_0 + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2q^2}_{V_\text{HO}(q)} ~~~\equiv~~~ \underbrace{\mp \mu_\text{B} B_0 \mp \mu_\text{B} a_{\vec q} q^2}_{V_\text{magnetic}(q)}
\end{align}

Identifying the position-dependent terms, the magnetic potential can be assigned the angular trap frequency $\omega_{\vec q}$ along the $\vec q$ coordinate axis:
\begin{align}\label{eq:trap_omega_definition}
    \omega_{\vec q} = \sqrt[]{\mp\frac{2 \mu_\text{B} a_{\vec q}}{m}}
\end{align}
In the following, the trapping potential is considered trapping in the ${\vec q}$ direction if $\omega_{\vec q}$ is real, and anti-trapping if $\omega_{\vec q}$ is imaginary. For high-field seekers, the potential is trapping if $a_{\vec q} < 0$ and anti-trapping if $a_{\vec q} > 0$, and vice versa for low-field seekers. This can be intuitively seen as high-field seekers are trapped if the field has a maximum and is concave, hence $a_{\vec q} < 0$, and the other way around for low-field seekers.

In a field landscape between two coils, if the potential is trapping along the arrangement axis, it is anti-trapping in the cross-axis directions, and vice versa. This is due to Earnshaw's theorem~\cite{earnshaw_nature_1842} stating that a magnetic field in three dimensions has the shape of a hyperboloid, and thus cannot have a global extremum rather than a saddle point. This implies that the magnetic field is curved into opposite directions along the on-axis and cross-axis directions, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:field_landscape}. The field in the on-axis direction is curved twice as much as in the cross-axis direction: $\frac{a_\text{on-axis}}{a_\text{cross-axis}} = -2$, hence the trap frequencies have a ratio of $\frac{|\omega_\text{on-axis}|}{|\omega_\text{cross-axis}|} = \sqrt{2}$~\cite{hagemann_setup_2020} (see also figure~\ref{fig:feshbach_field_trap_frequencies} in section~\ref{ch:field_characterization}).

Note that $a_{\vec q}$ relates to the field landscape along ${\vec q}$ as $a_{\vec q}  = \frac{1}{2} \pdv[2]{B}{q}$ which can be seen from the Taylor expansion $B(q) = \eval{B}_{0} + \eval{\pdv{B}{q}}_{0} q + \frac{1}{2} \eval{\pdv[2]{B}{q}}_{0} q^2 + \mathcal{O}(q^3)$ around $0$ identifying the second order term with $a_{\vec q} q^2$.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{pgfpicture}
        \pgftext{\input{\imagepath/field_landscape/field_landscape.pgf}}
    \end{pgfpicture}
    \caption{Field curvature at the center of a homogeneous field between two coils: While the curvature is positive along one axis (here along $y$, blue, anti-trapping for high-field seekers), it is negative along the other axis (here along $x$, red, trapping for high-field seekers).}
    \label{fig:field_landscape}
\end{figure}

The design goal for the coil arrangement with regard to the field curvature is to minimize the absolute trap frequency in each direction by setting the coil distance accordingly.

\section{Simulation}\label{ch:simulation}
In order to determine the optimal specifications and to characterize the coils, a simulation python library was developed (called \textit{coil simulation library}). It makes heavy use of the magnetic field Python library \textit{magpylib}~\cite{ortner_magpylib_2020, noauthor_magpylibmagpylib_nodate} providing magnetic field vectors at arbitrary positions originating from wire loops, straight wires, and permanent magnets of different shapes only from analytic calculations.

\subsection*{Modelling}
The \textit{coil simulation library} models arrangements of two or more coils sharing a common axis. The models are parameterized by the distance $d_\text{coil}$ of the coils to the center, the number $n_\text{coil}$, the radius $r_\text{coil}$, and the arrangement geometry of the windings of each coil, the spacing $w$ between the windings, and the current $I_\text{coil}$ flowing in each coil and, if desired, even in each winding.

A coil is modelled as a set $\mathcal{C}$ of circular wire loops $L(r, y, I)$ with radius $r$, center position $y$, and current $I$. As is the case for the FermiQP demonstrator, the wire loops are aligned with the $y$ axis. For the $n_\text{on-axis}$ on-axis windings and the $n_\text{cross-axis}$ cross-axis windings ($6$ and $5$ for the FermiQP demonstrator), each loop $L_{ac}$ with on-axis index $a \in \{0, \ldots, n_\text{on-axis} - 1\}$ and cross-axis index $c \in \{0, \ldots n_\text{cross-axis} - 1\}$ is defined as
\begin{align}
    L_{ac} = L \left(r_\text{coil} + r_{ac}, y_\text{coil} + y_{ac}, I_\text{coil}\right)
\end{align}
with the on-axis ($y$) and radial (cross-axis) offsets
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:coil_model_yac}
    y_{ac} &= w\cdot \left(a-\frac{n_\text{on-axis}}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\right) \\
    \label{eq:coil_model_rac}
    r_{ac} &= y_{ac} \tan \eta + w \cdot \left(c - \frac{n_\text{cross-axis}}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\end{align}
where $w$ is the side length of a wire, and $\eta$ is the opening angle of the parallelogram-shaped cross-section of the coil cone ($\eta = \SI{45}{\degree}$ for the coils in the FermiQP demonstrator). Figure~\ref{fig:coil_model} visualizes how a coil is modelled as a set of wire loops.

This way of modelling a coil neglects the spiral shape of the coil wire as well as the wire jumps between the layers of the coil.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/coil_model/coil_model.pdf}
    \caption{A coil is modelled as a set of wire loops with on-axis indices $a$ and cross-axis/radial indices $c$ (counted from $0$), here shown in the cross-section view. The layers along the coil axis enclose an angle $\eta$. In the case of the coils for the FermiQP demonstrator with $6 \times 5$ windings, $a$ corresponds to the $y$ axis, and $c$ corresponds to the radial axes in the $xz$ plane, and the angle $\eta$ is \SI[]{45}{\degree}. The winding $(a = 3, c=2)$ is exemplarily highlighted, according~\eqref{eq:coil_model_yac} and~\eqref{eq:coil_model_rac} it lies at $(y = y_0 + \frac{3}{2}w, r = r_0 + \frac{5}{2}w)$.}
    \label{fig:coil_model}
\end{figure}

For an arrangement, the library provides the user with magnetic field vectors and magnitudes at arbitrary positions, plots of the fields along the arrangement axes, maps of the field landscape in the arrangement, information about gradients and curvatures of the fields, resistances, inductances, dipole moments, $L\over R$ time constants, mutually exerted mechanical forces of the coils, and sketches of the winding geometry (see figure~\ref{fig:csl_sketches} for exemplary sketches for the Feshbach coils).

\end{figure}

The following paragraphs explain how these characteristics of the coils and fields are calculated in the \textit{coil simulation library}. More technical details of the implementation of the \textit{coil simulation library} and usage examples are given in the appendix chapter~\ref{ch:coil_simulation_library}. 

\subsection*{Coil properties}
The \textit{coil simulation library} provides the following fundamental coil properties:
\paragraph{Resistance}
The resistance $R$ of a coil is determined using the specific resistance of copper of $\rho_\text{copper} = \SI{1.7e-8}{\ohm\meter}$:
\begin{align}\label{eq:resistance_simulation}
    R_\mathcal{C} = \frac{\rho_\text{copper} \sum\limits_{L \in \mathcal{C}} 2\pi r_L} {w^2 - A_\text{non-conducting}}
\end{align}
with the non-conducting part of the cross-section area $A_\text{non-conducting}$ accounting for the insulation and the cross-section of the hollow wire.

\paragraph{Inductance and L/R time} The inductance of a coil can be determined as $L = \frac{\Phi}{I}$ with the magnetic flux $\Phi = \int B \dd A$ at a current $I$~\cite{demtroder_zeitlich_2013}. In the \textit{coil simulation library}, the flux through a wire loop is approximated as $\Phi \approx B \cdot \pi r^2$ with the total magnetic field $B$ at the center of the loop. The total inductance of a coil $\mathcal{C}$ is calculated as
\begin{align}\label{eq:inductance_simulation}
    L_\mathcal{C} = \sum\limits_{L \in \mathcal{C}} \frac{B(y = y_L) \pi r_L^2}{I_L}.
\end{align}

The time constant $\tau = \frac{L}{R}$ quantifies how fast the current in a coil with inductance $L$ and resistance $R$ can be switched by a sudden change of the applied voltage: $\Delta I(t) \propto 1-\exp \left(-\frac{t}{\tau}\right)$~\cite{demtroder_zeitlich_2013}. In the \textit{coil simulation library}, this time constant is estimated as
\begin{align}\label{eq:time_constant_simulation}
    \tau_\mathcal{C} = \frac{L_\mathcal{C}}{R_\mathcal{C}}.
\end{align}

For calculating $L$ and $\tau$ for a single coil, $B$ in~\eqref{eq:inductance_simulation} is set to the field solely generated by that respective coil. For estimating $L$ and $\tau$ of the coil when part of an arrangement of coils, $B$ is set to the field generated by the whole arrangement. This leads to higher $L$ and longer $\tau$ when operated in the homogeneous field mode and lower $L$ and shorter $\tau$ when operated in gradient mode. These in-arrangement values are only meaningful if the amount of current flowing in all coils is the same and coupled, and if the coils have the same geometry.\footnote{With the current in the individual coils being coupled, the whole arrangement can be thought of as a single coil consisting of multiple interconnected sub-coils at different positions. The inductance of the arrangement is then calculated with the total magnetic field produced by all sub-coils of the arrangement, and can be thought of as a sum of the individual inductances of the sub-coils.}

\paragraph{Dipole moment}
The magnetic dipole moment $\vec m$ of a coil determines the force $\vec F = \vec m (\vec \nabla \vec B)$ and torque $T = \vec m \times \vec B$ it experiences in a magnetic field. Furthermore, the magnetic field generated on the coil axis ($y$) by a magnetic moment $\vec m$ can be calculated as $\vec B = \frac{\mu_0 \vec m}{2\pi y^3}$ in the far-field ($y \gg r$). For a wire loop, it is defined as $\vec m = I \vec A$ with the coil axis vector $\vec A$ having the length of the wire loop cross-section area~\cite{demtroder_statische_2013}. In the \textit{coil simulation library}, the magnetic moment of a coil $\mathcal{C}$ is calculated as
\begin{align}\label{eq:dipole_moment_simulation}
    m_\mathcal{C} = \sum\limits_{L \in \mathcal{C}} I_L \cdot \pi r_L^2,
\end{align}
and analogously for an arrangement $\mathcal{A}$.

\subsection*{Field properties}
The \textit{coil simulation library} provides the following properties of the field generated by an arrangement:

\paragraph{Curvature and Trap Frequency}
The field curvature $a_q$ along an axis $q$ in an arrangement $\mathcal{A}$ as defined in chapter~\ref{ch:field_curvature_definition} is calculated from sampled magnetic field strength values $B_i(\vec 0 + d \cdot \vec q)$ for distances $d$ from the center along the $\vec q$ axis. In the \textit{coil simulation library}, the curvature is determined from \SI{200}{} samples in a region of $\SI{+-3.5}{\milli\meter}$ around the center as a default. A degree-7 polynomial ${\hat B(d) = \sum_{i=0}^7 c_i d^i}$ is fit to the sampled data. The curvature is then the second coefficient of the fit: $a_{\vec q} = \hat c_2$.

The high-field seeker trap frequency is calculated as (cf. equation \ref{eq:trap_omega_definition})
\begin{align}\label{eq:trap_frequency_simulation}
    f_{\mathcal{A},~\vec q,~\text{high-field seeker}} = \frac{1}{2\pi}  \sqrt{\left| \frac{2 \hat c_2 \mu_\text{B}}{m_{^6\text{Li}}} \right|} (-\mathrm{sgn} \hat c_2)
\end{align}
which is positive if the field is trapping and negative if anti-trapping for high-field seekers along $\vec q$.

\paragraph{Gradient}
The gradient in an arrangement $\mathcal{A}$, meaning the linear component of the field landscape, along $\vec q$ is determined from the same polynomial fit as for the curvature:
\begin{align}\label{eq:gradient_simulation}
    g_{\mathcal{A},~\vec q} = \eval{\pdv[]{B}{q}}_{q = 0} = \hat c_1
\end{align}

\paragraph{Mechanical Force}
The axial mechanical force on a coil $\mathcal{C}$ in the field of an arrangement is estimated using its magnetic moment and the field gradient: $\vec F = \vec m (\vec \nabla \vec B)$. As the magnetic moment only has a $y$ component, just the axial gradient of the field is relevant. The force on the coil is calculated as the sum of the windings' magnetic moments $m_L = I_L \cdot \pi r_L^2$ multiplied by the approximated $y$ gradient $\eval{\pdv[]{B}{y}}_{y = y_L} \approx \frac{B(y_L + s) - B(y_L)}{s}$:
\begin{align}\label{eq:mechanical_force_simulation}
    F_\mathcal{C} \approx \sum\limits_{L \in \mathcal{C}} m_L \cdot \eval{\pdv[]{B}{y}}_{y = y_L} \approx \sum\limits_{L \in \mathcal{C}} I_L \pi r_L^2 \left(\frac{B(y_L + s)-B(y_L)}{s}\right)
\end{align}
with a default step length $s = \SI{0.5}{\milli\meter}$.

This approximation is coarse, not only because of the approximation of the gradient, but especially because the finite radial extent of the coil was neglected, meaning that the coil was assumed to be small compared to the radial distance on which the $y$ gradient changes.




\section{Coil Properties}\label{ch:coil_properties}
In this section, an overview of the geometrical specifications and the operational properties of the individual Fesh\-bach coils for the FermiQP demonstrator is given. Their quality is assessed based on on-axis field measurements.

The coils were produced by an external manufacturer\footnote{Krämer Energietechnik, Am Escheberger Weg 8a, 34289 Zierenberg, Germany}. In consultation with them, the required specifications were determined by optimizing the field curvature and peak field in the homogeneous field mode with the \textit{coil simulation library}. In total, three coils were purchased, two for operation in the FermiQP demonstrator and one spare. They are called \textit{Gauss}, \textit{Maxwell}, and \textit{Tesla}.

\subsection*{Geometry}
A center-of-mass radius of \SI{83}{\milli\meter} was decided for. The six layers with five windings each are grouped into three pancakes (outer, middle, and inner) with two supply lines each. All of them connect to the coil at the same azimuthal point, as drawn in figure~\ref{fig:single_coil_drawing}. 

The wire was specified to have side lengths of \SI{5.3}{\milli\meter}, \SI{0.3}{\milli\meter} of which stem from the Kapton insulation. The round hollow core has a diameter of \SI{3.0}{\milli\meter}. The wire layers are coated in epoxy material for fixing their position, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:coil_geometry_specification}.

        \label{fig:coil_geometry_specification}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Specified geometry and cross-section of the Feshbach coils}
\end{figure}

More details of the geometrical specification as well as some measured geometrical properties of the three coils are listed in the appendix chapter~\ref{ch:feshbach_coil_geometrical_properties}.

The coils will be held in place using holders designed by the engineering advisors of the FermiQP demonstrator, made out of the non-magnetic material PEEK. Massive spacers between the two coils tightly fix them for impeding vibrations and ensuring that they cannot change their distance due to any field gradient-induced forces.

\subsection*{Operational Properties}
The operational properties introduced in section \ref{ch:simulation} were simulated using the \textit{coil simulation library} and are listed in table~\ref{tab:operational_properties}.

In a four-point measurement, the resistance of the middle pancake of the \textit{Gauss} coil (wire length roughly $\frac{\SI{15.7}{\meter}}{3}$) with estimated \SI{6}{\meter} of supply line wire was measured to be \SI{12.8}{\milli\ohm}. The expected value of $\rho_\text{copper} \cdot \frac{(\SI{5}{\milli\meter})^2 - \pi(\SI{1.5}{\milli\meter})^2}{\SI{15.7}{\meter}/3 + \SI{6}{\meter}} \approx \SI{11}{\milli\ohm}$ is on the same order of magnitude. The experimenters reckon that the resistance might be higher than expected due the bends in the wire.

Additionally, the coil was set up to form an $LC$ circuit together with an oscilloscope of $C = \SI{15}{\pico\farad}$ to verify the simulated inductance of \SI{15}{\milli\henry}. In this setup, the supply lines of the coil were wound up to coils of $9$ windings with a radius of about \SI{11}{\centi\meter}, leading to an estimated additional inductance of $L_\text{supply} = \frac{N\Phi}{I} = \frac{N^2\mu_0\pi r}{2} \approx \SI{0.02}{\milli\henry}$. The resonance frequency of the circuit was experimentally determined as $f = \SI{3.19}{\mega\hertz}$ which allows to estimate the inductance of the coil:
\begin{align}
    f = \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{(L_\text{coil} + L_\text{supply})C}} ~\Rightarrow~ L_\text{coil} = \left(\frac{1}{2\pi f \sqrt{C}}\right)^2 - L_\text{supply} \approx \SI{0.15}{\milli\henry}
\end{align}
which corroborates that the simulated value is realistic.

\subsection*{Magnetic Fields}
Using a Sensys FGM3D/1000 fluxgate magnetic field probe (dominant relative error of \SI{0.5}{\percent}), the on-axis magnetic field produced by the three coils \textit{Gauss}, \textit{Maxwell}, and \textit{Tesla} at $I = \SI{1.000}{\ampere}$ was mapped, as displayed in figure~\ref{fig:single_coil_fields}. The measured values $B$ were fit to the following model for the on-axis field of \SI{30}{} spatially separated wire loops~\cite{demtroder_statische_2013}:
\begin{align}\label{eq:on_axis_field_model}
    \hat B[I, r, y_0](y) = \sum\limits_{a = 0}^5 \sum\limits_{c = 0}^4 \frac{\mu_0 I}{2} \frac{r_{ac}^2}{\left(r_{ac}^2 + (y - y_{ac})^2\right)^\frac{3}{2}}
\end{align}
with the position $y_{ac} = y_0 + (a - 2.5) w$ and the radius $r_{ac} = r + (c-2)w$ of a winding with on-axis index $a$, cross-axis index $c$, and a winding spacing $w$.

With root mean square error\footnote{$RMSE[B, \hat B] = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^N (B_i-\hat B_i)^2}$} values of $<\SI{3}{\milli\gauss}$, which is about \SI{e-3}{} of the maximum field, the model fits the observed field landscapes very well. From the resulting parameters $\hat I$, $\hat r$, and $\hat y_0$ (listed in table~\ref{tab:single_coil_fields_fit_parameters}) it can be concluded that the coils cannot produce the same maximum field and that they act like they are operated at different currents and/or have slightly different dimensions.\footnote{In the fit, the estimated parameters $\hat I$ and $\hat r$ are nearly collinear (correlation of \SI{99.9976}{\percent}), which can be understood from $\hat B \propto \frac{I}{r}$ for $y^2 \ll r^2$. This means that the deviations from the estimated field values cannot distinctively be attributed to either the radius or the current.}
Comparing the measured and the simulated fields via $RMSE[B, B_\text{simulated}]$ (see table~\ref{tab:single_coil_fields_fit_parameters}), one can also see that \textit{Tesla} matches the expected field landscape best, followed by \textit{Gauss}, and then \textit{Maxwell} very far off.

In order to investigate the origin of these problematic differences, the individual pancakes of all coils were characterized with respect to the maximum field they produce at $I = \SI{1.000}{\ampere}$, as listed in table~\ref{tab:pancake_characterization}. The values show that even the respective outer, middle, and inner pancakes of the individual coils differ significantly in terms of the magnetic fields they produce.

    \label{tab:pancake_characterization}
\end{table}

These differences between the coils could originate from geometrical irregularities introduced during the manufacturing process, electrical shorts (which are rather unlikely considering that every pancake would be affected), the layer jumps, or other imperfections. During the writing of this thesis, the reason of these deviances could not be clearly identified. The different fields and effective geometrical scales of the coils need to be taken into account when setting the coil distance and the respective operating currents for getting a flat and curvature-free homogeneous field. \textit{Gauss} and \textit{Tesla} were selected to be used for the implementation coil arrangement as they fulfill the expectations best.


\section{Field Characterization}\label{ch:field_characterization}
\subsection*{Homogeneous Field}
The homogeneous field was first characterized with respect to the magnitude at the center and its curvature using the \textit{coil simulation library}. The measured field landscapes for the coils \textit{Gauss} and \textit{Tesla} were then used to optimize the operating current and position of each coil.

\paragraph{Simulation}
The expected trap frequency of the arrangement of the Feshbach coils was determined for different coil positions with the \textit{coil simulation library}. As can be seen from figure~\ref{fig:feshbach_field_trap_frequencies}, the theoretically optimal position of the center of mass of the coils is at about \SI{42.8}{\milli\meter} for which the absolute trap frequencies are minimal in both on-axis and cross-axis direction.

\begin{figure}

    \caption{Dependency of the trap frequency on the position of the Feshbach coils (calculated from data simulated with the \textit{coil simulation library}, positive trap frequencies denote a trapping, negative an anti-trapping potential for high-field seekers): If the coils are positioned \SI{+-42.8}{\milli\meter} away from the arrangement center, the absolute trap frequency becomes minimal for both the on-axis and cross-axis/radial directions. For positions close and farther from the center, it can be seen that, if one axis is trapping, the other is always anti-trapping, with a trap frequency ratio of $-\sqrt{2}$.}

The simulated field landscape in this optimal configuration is mapped in figure~\ref{fig:feshbach_field_map}, the fields along the coil axis and the cross-axis are displayed in figures~\ref{fig:feshbach_field_slices} and~\ref{fig:feshbach_field_slices_detail}. The expected maximum field at the center in this configuration is \SI{1309}{\gauss}.

Table~\ref{tab:feshbach_properties} lists some properties of the arrangement and its field in the homogeneous field mode. The switching time constant of \SI[]{13}{\milli\second} could be critically high when fast scanning of the field magnitude is required, calling for additional measures to shorten it, e.g. by applying a strong voltage boost with the power supplies or adding additional resistance to the coil circuits.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Optimization of Current and Position}
The observed difference in the measured field landscapes of \textit{Gauss} and \textit{Tesla} (see figure~\ref{fig:single_coil_fields}) call for an optimization of their respective position and current such that the curvature of the homogeneous field is minimal and has as little gradient as possible.

To this end, the current of each coil was adjusted by the factor ${\hat r^2}/{(\hat r^2 + \hat y_0^2)^\frac{3}{2}}$ (cf. equation~\ref{eq:on_axis_field_model}) such that the fields in the center are nearly equivalent:
\begin{align}
    \frac{I_{\text{optimal}, \textit{Gauss}}}{I_{\text{optimal}, \textit{Tesla}}} = \frac{\hat r_\textit{Tesla}^2 / (\hat r_\textit{Tesla}^2 + \hat y_{0, \textit{Tesla}}^2)^\frac{3}{2}}{\hat r_\textit{Gauss}^2 / (\hat r_\textit{Gauss}^2 + \hat y_{0, \textit{Gauss}}^2)^\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{\SI{400}{\ampere}}{\SI{396.5}{\ampere}}
\end{align}

The coil positions were then optimized in a grid-search way by varying them between \SI{39.0}{\milli\meter} and \SI{44}{\milli\meter} in steps of \SI{0.5}{\milli\meter}, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:position_optimization}. Using sampled data from the fit model~\eqref{eq:on_axis_field_model}, the trap frequency and the gradient were determined for each pair of positions using~\eqref{eq:trap_frequency_simulation} and~\eqref{eq:gradient_simulation}.
The optimal values found are listed in table~\ref{tab:position_optimization_results}. The positions of $y_{0, \textit{Gauss}} = \SI{-41.0}{\milli\meter}$ and $y_{0, \textit{Gauss}} = \SI{41.5}{\milli\meter}$ are suggested to be used as for these the trap frequency is minimal (\SI{0.63}{\hertz}) and the gradient is almost negligible (\SI{-0.07}{\gauss\per\centi\meter}). Compared to the originally projected coil distance of about \SI{85.5}{\milli\meter}, the optimal distance of $\SI{41}{\milli\meter} + \SI{41.5}{\milli\meter} = \SI{82.5}{\milli\meter}$ for the actual coils is \SI{3}{\milli\meter} more narrow.

The expected field landscape generated by \textit{Gauss} and \textit{Tesla} with optimized currents and positions is plotted in figure~\ref{fig:optimized_projected_landscape}. At the time of writing of this thesis, the holder for the coils were not yet manufactured such that an experimental verification of this optimal configuration and further optimization is still pending.

The \textit{coil simulation library} has simplified the specification and optimization process of the Feshbach coils a lot and might also be a useful tool for other coil implementations, also in future experiments. In order not to rely on it even for coarsely estimating fields and gradients in a Helmholtz coil arrangement, two handy rules of thumb have been formulated in the appendix chapter \ref{ch:rules_of_thumb} for estimating the field and gradient in the center of a coil arrangement in Helmholtz configuration.

Despite all the thoughts that went into the planning and characterization of the Feshbach coils, the experimenters of the FermiQP demonstrator will still need to optimize their operation in the running experiment as soon as its progress allows to.
