\chapter{FermiQP: a Fermion Quantum Processor}
In this chapter, the FermiQP quantum gas microscopy experiment is introduced. It is first presented as a platform for quantum simulations and quantum computing. Then the projected experimental setup is outlined.

\section{A Versatile Microscope for Quantum Gases}\label{ch:quantum_gas_microscopy}
Within the last two decades, quantum gas microscopes have evolved into a well-proven and auspicious platform for exploring the diversity of phenomena in quantum many-body systems as well as for researching condensed matter physics. In these machines, neutral atoms are cooled to sub-\si[]{\micro\kelvin} temperatures and arranged in regular patterns using optical lattices. Single-site imaging techniques allow resolving individual atoms and detecting their respective spin states~\cite{bloch_many-body_2008,gross_quantum_2017, gross_quantum_2021}, granting access to the physics of their interactions.

A key premise of these experimental explorations is that, rather than simulating quantum phenomena on classical computers using established models of physics, it can be by far more advantageous to research them in controllable and isolated quantum systems~\cite{feynman_simulating_1982}. The main drawback of computer simulations is that the size of the models and the computation time necessary to solve them scale exponentially with the extent of the described system.

While the first quantum gas microscopes in the late 2000s were based on bosonic rubidium~\cite{bakr_quantum_2009, sherson_single-atom-resolved_2010}, first results from experiments using fermionic alkali atoms were published in 2015, such as for potassium~\cite{cheuk_quantum-gas_2015, haller_single-atom_2015} and lithium \cite{parsons_site-resolved_2015, omran_microscopic_2015}.

Launched in 2021, FermiQP is one of the newest fermion quantum gas microscopy projects using lithium. It aims for surpassing existing fermionic lithium experiments with respect to precision, the number of trapped atoms, as well as coherence and atom lifetime. It will combine two modes of operation: In the so-called \textit{analog mode}, FermiQP will use the lithium atoms in optical lattices for investigating the nature of strongly interacting fermionic particles, which can be described by the Fermi-Hubbard model~\cite{hubbard_electron_1963, esslinger_fermi-hubbard_2010}. In the \textit{digital mode} on the other hand, FermiQP will act as a quantum computing platform exploiting the properties of its fermionic atoms and taking advantage of the long coherence times and the parallelizability of gate operations in optical lattices~\cite{zhang_functional_2022}. The key advantage over other platforms for quantum computing is the comparatively high qubit number scalability of quantum gases in optical lattices.

FermiQP is a consortium of many contributing institutes and scientific groups in different areas of physics across Germany. The \textit{FermiQP demonstrator} quantum gas microscope is being built at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching where this thesis was written.

The rest of this section introduces the techniques used in the FermiQP demonstrator and its projected features, followed by an overview of the planned experimental realization in the next section.

\subsection*{Laser Cooling}\label{ch:laser_cooling}
Cooling and trapping of atoms with laser light~\cite{foot_atomic_2005,metcalf_laser_1999} is the necessary first step for a quantum gas microscope to run. With the idea dating back to the 1970s~\cite{hansch_cooling_1975}, these techniques have paved the way for a whole range of experiments exploring the world of atoms in ultracold regimes. After the 1997 Nobel Prize was awarded ``for development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light''~\cite{noauthor_nobel_nodate}, they have become a well-established technique employed in a multitude of quantum gas experiments, which themselves have led to the 2001 Nobel Prize for achieving Bose-Einstein condensation~\cite{noauthor_nobel_nodate-1}.

In the FermiQP demonstrator, different laser cooling techniques will be used: The atoms are first cooled and confined with a two-~\cite{qesja_notitle_2022} and a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap~\cite{foot_atomic_2005}, the latter of which is described in chapter~\ref{ch:mot}. Then gray molasses cooling~\cite{weidemuller_novel_1994} and evaporative cooling~\cite{foot_atomic_2005, sun_construction_2022} bring them into the sub-\si[]{\micro\kelvin} regime.

\subsection*{Optical Lattices}\label{ch:optical_lattices}
Optical lattices are used to confine the cooled atoms into individual sites arranged in regular patterns. These patterns are created by standing waves of high-power laser beams creating repeated potential wells via dipole forces at points with high intensity  half a wavelength apart from each other. Using multiple lattice beams, arbitrary lattice geometries can be implemented by varying the angle of the beams to each other and their respective phases, polarizations, and powers. Figures~\ref{fig:2d_lattice} and~\ref{fig:1d_lattice} illustrate how optical lattices confine atoms in regular patterns. To prevent driving transitions in the atom, the lattice lasers are far off-resonant~\cite{bloch_many-body_2008, bloch_quantum_2012}.

In the FermiQP demonstrator, multiple lattices are going to be used, most notably the science lattice at \SI[]{1064}{\nano\meter} laser wavelength providing the two-dimensional regular pattern in which the atoms are positioned for the experiments, and the deeper pinning lattice with less distance between the lattice sites, ensuring that the atoms are well-confined when imaging light is shone in. Raman sideband cooling will cool the atoms while they are confined in their lattice sites~\cite{hilker_spin-resolved_2017, krumm_notitle_2022}.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Schematics of optical lattices}
    \label{fig:lattices}
\end{figure}

The FermiQP demonstrator will implement the superlattice technique: By overlapping an optical lattice with another lattice of double the lattice spacing, every other potential barrier between two sites can be lowered, creating an array of double-wells. By varying the phase and amplitude of the lattice beams, different barrier heights and well levels can be realized, allowing control over the tunneling rate between the sites of the double-well.

\subsection*{Imaging}
FermiQP will implement fluorescence imaging, meaning that light scattered by the atoms is used as an imaging signal, and absorption imaging, meaning that the atoms reveal their presence by absorbing light passing through their lattice site. Two objectives will be used for collecting the imaging signal. In addition to observing positions, spin states of the atoms can be read out using spin-resolving detection techniques, which work e.g.~by spatially separating atoms of different spin states into the two double-well sites~\cite{boll_spin-_2016} or into different layers perpendicular to the lattice plane~\cite{koepsell_robust_2020} with magnetic fields like in a Stern-Gerlach experiment. An example of spin-resolved imaging is shown in figure~\ref{fig:absorption_image}.

    \label{fig:absorption_image}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Quantum Simulations in the Analog Mode}\label{ch:analog_mode}
In the analog operation mode, the fermionic lithium atoms in the optical lattices are used for simulating phenomena of Fermi gases, such as the Mott-insulating and anti-ferromagnetic phases, as well as fermions paired to bosonic molecules, superfluidity,  superconductivity, and others~\cite{bloch_quantum_2012,esslinger_fermi-hubbard_2010}. These phases emerge as different domains in the Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian describing a system of fermions in the lowest energy band at lattice sites $i$ and $j$ with spin state $\nu \in \{{\uparrow}, {\downarrow}\}$~\cite{hubbard_electron_1963,esslinger_fermi-hubbard_2010}:
\begin{align}\label{eq:fermi_hubbard_hamiltonian}
    \hat H =
    \underbrace{-t \sum\limits_{\Braket{i,j}, \nu} \left(\hat a^\dagger_{i, \nu} \hat a_{j, \nu} + \text{h.c.}\right)}_\text{kinetic term/tunneling}
    + \underbrace{U \sum\limits_i \hat n_{i, {\uparrow}} \hat n_{i, {\downarrow}}}_\text{on-site interaction}
    + \underbrace{\sum\limits_{i, \nu} \epsilon_{i} \hat n_{i, \nu}}_\text{offset}
\end{align}
with $\Braket{i,j}$ meaning that $i$ and $j$ are neighboring sites. The first term describes the rate of tunneling of a particle between two neighboring sites with the creation operator $\hat a^\dagger$ and the annihilation operator $\hat a$. The tunneling $t$ can be set in optical lattice experiments by lowering the potential barrier between sites, as hinted at above, and reciprocally depends on the atomic mass~\cite{jaksch_cold_1998} implying comparatively high tunneling rates for the lightweight lithium atoms. The on-site interaction term describes the energy shift $U$ in sites where two atoms (in different spin states) are present, with $U > 0$ denoting repulsive and $U < 0$ denoting attractive interactions. $\hat n$ is the atom number operator. The interaction between atoms on the same site depends on the s-wave scattering length $a$ and the atom mass $m$ as $U \propto \frac{a}{m}$. $a$ can be varied in the experiment using Feshbach resonances as outlined in the next paragraph. Finally, the term $\epsilon_i$ denotes a site-dependent potential offset~\cite{esslinger_fermi-hubbard_2010}.

    \label{fig:fermi_hubbard_schematic}
\end{figure}

\paragraph*{Feshbach Resonances} Feshbach resonances allow varying the scattering length $a$ of certain atoms by applying a constant magnetic field and therefore also the on-site interaction $U$ in the Fermi-Hubbard model. In the collision process of two atoms, this magnetic field sets the energy difference between two states of the atoms, a scattering state and a bound molecular state with different magnetic moments. At a certain magnetic field $B_0$, these energy levels coincide and the scattering length becomes infinite, which is a Feshbach resonance. For $B < B_0$, the scattering length is positive, $a > 0$, and $U$ is repulsive, whereas for $B > B_0$, one gets $a < 0$ and attractive $U$~\cite{chin_feshbach_2010}:
\begin{align}
    a(B) = a_\text{background} \left(1 - \frac{\Delta}{B-B_0}\right)
\end{align}
with the width $\Delta$ of the Feshbach resonance and the background scattering length $a_\text{background}$ at the absence of a magnetic field. Fermionic lithium has a broad ($\Delta \approx \SI[]{300}{\gauss}$) resonance at $B_0 = \SI[]{832}{\gauss}$~\cite{zurn_precise_2013} allowing a large variation of the on-site interaction in the FermiQP demonstrator experiment via adjustable magnetic fields of up to \SI[]{1200}{\gauss}.

\subsection*{Quantum Computing in the Digital Mode}\label{ch:digital_mode}
In the digital mode, FermiQP aims to serve as a platform for universal quantum computing with high qubit number scalability and gate parallelizability. Quantum computers make use quantum phenomena like entanglement and superposition to enable fast execution of certain quantum algorithms. Their classical counterparts scale exponentially with problem size and are thus very constrained by their execution time on classical computer hardware~\cite{nielsen_quantum_2010, hidary_quantum_2021, ladd_quantum_2010, mainzer_quantencomputer_2020}.

In quantum computing, the smallest unit of information is a so-called qubit, a two-level system of quantum states~\cite{nielsen_quantum_2010, hidary_quantum_2021, ladd_quantum_2010, mainzer_quantencomputer_2020}. In the FermiQP demonstrator, qubits are encoded in the two energetically lowest hyperfine magnetic sublevels of the $2\text{s}^2\text{S}_{1/2}$ manifold, called $\Ket{1}$ and $\Ket{2}$. In the Paschen-Back domain of high magnetic fields (\SIrange[]{500}{1000}{\gauss}), the lowest magnetic sublevels of this manifold are separated by \SI[]{80}{\mega\hertz}~\cite{gehm_properties_2003,wei_magnetic-field_2013} and can be coupled via Raman transitions.

The initialization of the qubits and logical operations on them require quantum gates of which universal quantum computers need to implement two kinds: single-qubit gates for rotating individual qubits and two-qubit gates for entangling pairs of qubits~\cite{nielsen_quantum_2010, hidary_quantum_2021, ladd_quantum_2010, mainzer_quantencomputer_2020}:

\paragraph*{Single-Qubit Gates}
Single-qubit gates in the FermiQP demonstrator will be implemented with Raman transitions driven by an ultraviolet tweezer beam at \SI[]{323}{\nano\meter} allowing addressing single individual sites of the optical lattice. Due to its low fine structure splitting, Raman transitions between the two aforementioned qubit states are highly suppressed in  fermionic lithium~\cite{wei_magnetic-field_2013}. In the FermiQP demonstrator, transitions between the two qubit states are therefore implemented with a detour over the magnetic sublevels $\Ket{5}$ and $\Ket{6}$ via global microwave and radio-frequency pulses, as illustrated in more detail in figure~\ref{fig:single_qubit_gates}.

    \caption{Single qubit gate scheme in the FermiQP demonstrator (figure by Robin Groth): The states $\Ket{1}$ and $\Ket{2}$ in the $2\text{S}_{1/2}$ manifold constitute a qubit.
    \SI[]{323}{\nano\meter} addressing beams couple $\Ket{1}$ with $\Ket{6}$ by a Raman transition via the $3\text{P}_{1/2}$ manifold. This Raman coupling can be driven selectively by focusing the \SI[]{323}{\nano\meter} beam onto individual sites of the optical lattice.
    A combination of a microwave (MW) and a radio-frequency (RF) pulse applied on all lattice sites couples $\Ket{2}$ and $\Ket{6}$ via $\Ket{5}$ (fig.~\ref{fig:single_qubit_gates_levels}).\\
    A single qubit gate operation consists of a global MW-RF pulse combination, then the local Raman addressing, and another global MW-RF pulse combination (fig.~\ref{fig:single_qubit_gate_scheme}).
    In the addressed qubit, $\Ket{1}$ is coupled with $\Ket{6}$ via the Raman transition, which then is coupled to $\Ket{2}$ by the MW-RF pulses; $\Ket{2}$, on the other hand, is coupled by the MW-RF pulses to $\Ket{6}$, and then to $\Ket{1}$ via the Raman transition.
    All qubits that are not addressed by the Raman beam are preserved: The two MW-RF pulse combinations bring the $\Ket{2}$ qubits back to their original state while leaving the $\Ket{1}$ qubits unaffected.}
    \label{fig:single_qubit_gates}
\end{figure}

\paragraph*{Two-Qubit Gates}
Two-qubit operations in the FermiQP demonstrator will be implemented with collisional gates in double-wells of the superlattice. There, two atoms are entangled by lowering the potential barrier and allowing interaction between them. While the idea of collisional two-qubit gates in optical lattices dates back more than two decades~\cite{jaksch_fast_2000, anderlini_controlled_2006,trotzky_time-resolved_2008}, they have just recently been implemented with quantum computing in optical lattices entering the realm of possibility~\cite{dai_generation_2016, yang_cooling_2020, zhang_functional_2022}. These implementations, however, don't allow for individual gate control yet.

Gate operations on arbitrary pairs of atoms can be performed by moving them into neighboring lattice sites in the double-wells of the superlattice with an optical tweezer, and then lowering the double-well barriers such that the atoms interact, as depicted in figure~\ref{fig:two_qubit_gates}. These two-qubit gate operations can be conducted for multiple pairs of atoms in parallel as lowering the potential barrier is a global operation, hence all neighboring pairs of atoms in double-wells interact at the same time.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{\imagepath/two_qubit_gates/two_qubit_gates.pdf}
    \caption{Two-qubit collisional gate scheme in the FermiQP demonstrator: a: Two atoms that are supposed to be entangled are moved into neighboring sites using an optical tweezer. b: The atoms are entangled by lowering the potential barrier in the double well (b.2) and letting the atoms interact. When the potential barrier is ramped up again, the two atoms stay entangled (purple ellipse). c: Then the atoms are moved to their original positions with the entanglement preserved.}
    \label{fig:two_qubit_gates}
\end{figure}

These quantum gates can also be a useful tool for preparing arbitrary initial configurations for Fermi-Hubbard simulations, representing a considerable advantage of combining both operation modes in one device.



\section{Experimental Setup of the FermiQP Demonstrator}

\subsection*{Components of the Setup}
The fermionic lithium atoms in the FermiQP demonstrator will be prepared under ultra-high vacuum conditions and trapped in the optical lattices in a glass cell. The vacuum chamber and all adjacent features of the experiment are illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:chamber} and explained in the following.

\begin{figure}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Design of the vacuum chamber: In the high-vacuum (HV) chamber, atoms are ejected from the oven into the two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (2D MOT) where the atoms are confined to a one-dimensional cloud. This cloud of atoms is then pushed along the $x$ axis through a differential pumping stage into the ultra-high vacuum (HV) region. There, they reach the glass cell where they are captured by a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap. The objectives for imaging are positioned above and below the glass cell, the coils for creating magnetic fields and gradients sit on the sides, held together by a metal cube. Some exemplary cooling and lattice laser beams shone into the glass cell are shown in the detail view (red and green tubes).}
    \label{fig:chamber}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Vacuum System}
The vacuum system of the FermiQP demonstrator experiment will consist of two sections: the high vacuum oven section with pressures down to \SI[]{e-10}{\milli\bar} and the ultra-high vacuum science section down to \SI[]{5e-12}{\milli\bar} where the atoms are kept in a cuboid-shaped uncoated glass cell  with $\SI[]{12}{\milli\meter} \times \SI[]{12}{\milli\meter}$ inner cross-section. The low pressure there avoids collisions with other particles and so guarantees long atom lifetimes. The vacuum is maintained by two ion and non-evaporable getter pumps on top of the chamber. The two sections are connected with a thin differential pumping tube with low conductivity impeding the flow of residual gas from the high vacuum to the ultra-high vacuum section, still allowing a beam of atoms to pass through.

\paragraph{Cooling Cycle}
The fermionic lithium atoms will be ejected from a liquid lithium reservoir in the oven located in the lower part of the high vacuum part. Atop the oven, they are going to reach the two-dimensional magneto-optical trap where they will be confined to a thread-like atomic filament along the $x$ axis~\cite{qesja_notitle_2022}.  A push beam along this axis will give them momentum such that they fly through the differential pumping tube into the ultra-high vacuum section to the glass cell. Using a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap makes the vacuum chamber very compact compared to a setup with a Zeeman slower, still providing the necessary flux and quality of the atomic beam~\cite{tiecke_high-flux_2009}.

At the glass cell, the atoms will be recaptured in a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap which was designed within the scope of this thesis (chapter~\ref{ch:mot}). The atoms are then going to be cooled down further with the gray molasses technique (also in chapter~\ref{ch:mot}) and evaporative cooling in an optical dipole trap~\cite{sun_construction_2022} such that they can be loaded into the optical lattices.

\paragraph{Lasers}
The FermiQP demonstrator will use several laser frequencies, most notably the near-resonant \SI[]{671}{\nano\meter} light for cooling the atoms in the magneto-optical traps, the gray molasses, and during Raman sideband cooling in the optical lattice, far off-resonant \SI[]{1064}{\nano\meter}, \SI[]{1070}{\nano\meter}, and \SI[]{532}{\nano\meter} light for trapping in the optical dipole trap and the optical lattices as well as \SI[]{323}{\nano\meter} light for Raman addressing.

\paragraph{Imaging}
Imaging signals will be collected by two high-numerical aperture objectives, one for visible and one for ultraviolet light, sitting below and above the glass cell. During imaging, the atoms caught in the optical lattices can be pinned down by a deep and narrow-spaced pinning lattice such that incident imaging light doesn't push them out of their positions.

\paragraph{Magnetic Fields}
The magnetic gradients for the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap and the Fesh\-bach fields will be created by coils sitting left and right of the glass cell. They were developed and characterized during this thesis (in chapter~\ref{ch:coils}). In addition to that, six compensation coils around the experiment table provide arbitrary offset fields of up to \SI[]{3}{\gauss} at the position of the trapped atoms.

\subsection*{Setup of the Laboratory}
After its start in an empty laboratory in late 2021, the experimental infrastructure of the FermiQP demonstrator has been set up during the course of this thesis. Optical tables have been put into place and essential optical and electrical components have been purchased. By the time this thesis was submitted, trap laser setups, a locking cavity, compensation coils, and very recently also the vacuum chamber have been installed on the tables, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:lab_impressions}.
