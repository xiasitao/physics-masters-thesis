\chapter{FermiQP: a Fermion Quantum Processor}
In this chapter, the FermiQP quantum gas microscopy experiment is introduced. It is first presented as a platform for quantum simulations and quantum computing. Then the projected experimental setup is explained.

\section{A Versatile Microscope for Quantum Gases}
Within the last two decades, quantum gas microscopes have evolved into a well-proven and auspicious platform for exploring the nature of atoms in correlated systems and researching the phenomena of quantum many-body physics. In these machines, atoms are cooled down to sub \si[]{\micro\kelvin} \todo{Or even less?} temperatures and caught in regular patterns with the optical lattice or optical tweezer techniques\todo{check if that is called qgm too}. Single-site imaging techniques allow resolving individual atoms and detecting their respective states~\cite{bloch_many-body_2008,gross_quantum_2017, gross_quantum_2021}, granting access to the physics of their interactions. The underlying premise of this experimental approach is that for exploring the quantum realm, rather than simulating quantum phenomena on classical computers using established models of physics, which scale exponentially with the size of the described system, it is by far more advantageous to map these phenomena to controllable quantum systems and simulate them, as already suggested by Richard Feynman in 1982~\cite{feynman_simulating_1982}.

While the first quantum gas microscopes in the late 2000s were based on bosonic rubidium (e.g.~\cite{sherson_single-atom-resolved_2010}), for experiments using fermionic alkali atoms  first results were published in 2015, such as for potassium~\cite{cheuk_quantum-gas_2015} and lithium \cite{parsons_site-resolved_2015, omran_microscopic_2015}.

The FermiQP project, which started in 2021, is one of the newest fermion quantum gas microscopy experiments operated with lithium. It aims for surpassing existing fermionic lithium experiments with respect to their atom number, precision and atom lifetime in the microscope\todo{Really? Anything else}. It will combine two modes of operation: In the so-called \textit{analog mode}, FermiQP will use atoms in an optical lattice for investigating the nature of strongly interacting fermionic particles, which can be described by the Fermi-Hubbard model~\cite{hubbard_electron_1963, esslinger_fermi-hubbard_2010}. In the \textit{digital mode} on the other hand, FermiQP will act as a quantum computing platform exploiting the properties of its fermionic atoms, hence the name \textit{Fermion Quantum Processor}, where its key advantage over other platforms for quantum computing is the comparatively high scalability of quantum gases in optical lattices.

FermiQP is a consortium of many contributing institutes and scientific groups in different areas of physics across Germany. The actual quantum gas microscope, the \textit{FermiQP demonstrator}, is being built at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching, where this thesis was written.

The rest of this section introduces the techniques used in the FermiQP demonstrator and its projected features, followed by an overview of the planned experimental realization in the next section.

\subsection*{Laser Cooling}
Cooling and trapping of atoms with laser light is the necessary first step for a quantum gas microscope to run. With the idea dating back to the 1970s~\cite{hansch_cooling_1975}, it has paved the way for a whole realm of experiments exploring the world of atoms in ultracold regimes. After the 1997 nobel prize was awarded ``for development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light''\todo{citation}, they have become an established technique employed in a multitude of quantum gas experiments, which themselves have led to the 2001 nobel prize for achieving Bose-Einstein condensation\todo[]{citation}.

In the FermiQP demonstrator, different laser cooling techniques will be used: The atoms are first cooled and confined with a two- and a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap~\cite{foot_atomic_2005}, the latter of which is described in chapter~\ref{ch:mot}. Then gray molasses cooling~\cite{weidemuller_novel_1994} and evaporative cooling (see~\cite{foot_atomic_2005}, designed for FermiQP in~\cite{sun_construction_2022}), bring them into the \si[]{\micro\kelvin} regime.

\subsection*{Optical Lattices}
Optical lattices are then used to confine cooled individual atoms into sites arranged in regular patterns. These patterns are created by standing waves of high-power laser beams creating repeated dipole potential wells at points with high intensity. The spacing of these wells is half the wave length of the lattice laser light. Using multiple lattice beams, arbitrary lattice geometries can be implemented by varying the angle of the beams to each other and their respective phase and power.Figures~\ref{fig:2d_lattice} and~\ref{fig:1d_lattice} illustrate how optical lattices confine atoms in regular patterns. In order not to drive transitions in the atom, the laser is very far red-detuned~\cite{bloch_many-body_2008, bloch_quantum_2012}.

In the FermiQP demonstrator, multiple lattices are going to be used. Most notably the science lattice at \SI[]{1064}{\nano\meter} laser wave length providing the two-dimensional regular pattern that the atoms are positioned in for the experiments, and the deeper pinning lattice with less distance between the lattice sites, ensuring that the atoms are well-confined when imaging light is shone in.

    \label{fig:lattices}
\end{figure}

In FermiQP, the superlattice technique will be used: By overlapping the optical lattice with another lattice of double the lattice spacing, every other potential barrier between two sites can be lowered, creating a new lattice of double-wells. By varying the phase and amplitude of the lattice beams, different potential and barrier heights can be realized in the double-wells. This allows to control the tunneling rate between the sites of the double-well.

Raman sideband cooling will provide cooling for the atoms when they are confined in their lattice sites (see~\cite*{hilker_spin-resolved_2017}, designed for FermiQP in~\cite{krumm_notitle_2022}).

\subsection*{Imaging}
FermiQP will implement fluorescence imaging where light scattered by the atoms is used as an imaging signal and absorption imaging where the absorption of light reveals the position of individual atoms in the lattice. Two high-numerical aperture objectives will be used for collecting the imaging signal. In addition to observing positions, spin states of the atoms can be read out using spin-resolving detection techniques, e.g.~by spatially separating atoms of different spin state into the two double-well sites~\cite{boll_spin-_2016} or different layers in the third~\cite{koepsell_robust_2020} with magnetic fields like in a Stern-Gerlach experiment. An example of spin-resolved imaging is shown in figure~\ref{fig:absorption_image}.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Quantum Simulations in the Analog Mode}
In the analog operation mode, the fermionc lithium atoms in the optical lattices are used for simulating phenomena of Fermi gases, such as Mott insulators, superfluidity and  superconductivity, molecular phases of pair fermions, etc.~\cite{bloch_quantum_2012}. These phases emerge as different domains in the Fermi-Hubbard hamiltonian describing a system of fermions with spin state $\nu \in \{\Ket{\uparrow}, \Ket{\downarrow}\}$ in lattice sites $i$ and $j$:
\begin{align}
    \hat H =
    \underbrace{-t \sum\limits_{\Braket{i,j}, \nu} \left(\hat a^\dagger_{i, \nu} \hat a_{j, \nu} + \text{h.c.}\right)}_\text{kinetic term/tunneling}
    + \underbrace{U \sum\limits_i \hat n_{i, \Ket{\uparrow}} \hat n_{i, \Ket{\downarrow}}}_\text{on-site interaction}
    + \underbrace{\sum\limits_{i, \nu} \epsilon_{i} \hat n_{i\, \nu}}_\text{offset}
\end{align}
with $\Braket{i,j}$ meaning that $i$ and $j$ are neighboring sites~\cite{hubbard_electron_1963,esslinger_fermi-hubbard_2010}. The first term describes the rate of tunneling of a particle between two neighboring sites with the creation operator $\hat a^\dagger$ and the annihilation operator $\hat a$. The tunneling $t$ can be set in optical lattice experiments by lowering the potential barrier between sites, as hinted at above. The on-site interaction term describes the energy shift $U$ in sites where two atoms (in different spin states) are present, with $U > 0$ denoting repulsive and $U < 0$ denoting attractive interactions. The interaction between atoms on the same site is mediated by s-wave scattering. The mass of the particles and the free-space s-wave scattering length $a$ determine, along with other quantities, the interaction as $U \propto \frac{a}{m}$. The scattering length can be experimentally varied using Feshbach resonances as outlined in the next paragraph. Finally, $\epsilon$ is a site-dependent potential offset~\cite{esslinger_fermi-hubbard_2010}.

There they reach the glass cell where they are captured by the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap. The axis set such that the atomic beam towards the glass cell runs along the $x$ axis, the $z$ axis points to the left as seen from the atomic beam, the $y$ axis points upwards.}
