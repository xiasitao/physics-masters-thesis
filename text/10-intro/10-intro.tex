% With the idea dating back to the 1970s~\cite{hansch_cooling_1975}, laser cooling and trapping has paved the way for a whole realm of experiments exploring the world of atoms in ultracold regimes. After the 1997 nobel prize was awarded ''for development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light``, they have become an established technique employed in a multitude of quantum gas experiments, which themselves have led to the 2001 nobel prize for achieving Bose-Einstein condensation.
