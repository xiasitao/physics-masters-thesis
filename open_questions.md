- Why are coils left/right of glass cell?]
    - Raman sideband cooling needs pi and sigma pol?
    - Light must hence come parallel and perpendicular to mag field? -> no top/bottom
    - Why not front/back?
    SOLUTION: We want to drive $\pi$ transition through objective for Raman transitions, that means field must not be up/down.

- Polarisation in MOT optics
    - Is going forward and backward through QWP-HWP setup the same? Probably not
    - How to go about this, we have two degrees of freedom?
        - Formulate matrix M of QWP and HWP as a function of two angles
        - Say $M^-1 M (in) = (out)$ to find angles
    SOLUTION: In addition, measure polarisation with fixed sigma polarisation (created by a at the "atoms") before the outgoing glass plate, adjust the waveplates after the mirror (the "reflection stage"), and find the maximum on a cube on the way back after the "atoms" (see photo)
