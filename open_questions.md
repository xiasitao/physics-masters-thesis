- Why are coils left/right of glass cell?]
    - Raman sideband cooling needs pi and sigma pol?
    - Light must hence come parallel and perpendicular to mag field? -> no top/bottom
    - Why not front/back?

- Polarisation in MOT optics
    - Is going forward and backward through QWP-HWP setup the same? Probably not
    - How to go about this, we have two degrees of freedom?
        - Formulate matrix M of QWP and HWP as a function of two angles
        - Say $M^-1 M (in) = (out)$ to find angles
