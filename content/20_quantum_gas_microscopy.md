# 2. Quantum Gas Microscopy

- Laser cooling as prerequisite (Haensch 1975, Phillips & Metcals 1982)

- Optical lattices and quantum gases
    - explanation: dipole forces, standing waves, geometry
    - First realisation of bosonic (Greiner 2002) and fermionic gases (Koehl 2005) in optical lattices
    - Strong correlations (see Timon's thesis)

- First Lithium experiments (Schreck 2001, Truscott 2001)
- Advances in QGM, advances with Lithium
- technical state of the art

## Analog mode
- short overview over goals (Gross & Bloch 2017)
    - Hubbard Hamiltonian, phases
    - antiferromagnetism
    - high temperature superconductivity
    - quantum magnetism
    - geometries (Haldane)
    - magnetic polarons
    - hole pairing etc.
    - lattice gauge theories
- techniques
    - preparation
    - Feshbach resonances
- state of the art (difficult)
    - what has been investigated so far?
    - what is currently interesting?

## Digital mode
- short overview over goals and principles of quantum computing
    - goals
    - prerequisites (gates, coherence times, universality etc.)
- state of the art
    - not many optical lattice implementations (JWP 2020, 2022)
    - shortly mention tweezer implementations as an alternative (Lukin, Brouwaey)
- single qubit gate implementations (papers: Israel, Rubidium paper)
    - difference between lithium and other atoms: local AC (AC Stark shift) addressing not possible for lithium (there: shifting a single qubits hyperfine states with AC stark shift, only getting this to be resonant on the Rabi oscillation swapping the state, this is however dependent on the hyperfine structure "constant" and hence not strong enough for lithium, Israel theory paper)
    - explanation of our Raman gate
- two qubit gate implementations (papers: )
    - double well and history
    - collisional gates (JWP 2020, 2022)
    - sequence description
