- Analog mode & digital mode
    - analog: O(10) atoms
    - digital: scalability to O(1e3)

- Lithium
    - advantages: light weight (why? large lattice spacing possible/tunneling, Feshbach resonance, see Timon's thesis), tunability of two-body interactions (e.g. Grier 2013)
    - disadvantages: no coincidental sub-Doppler cooling in MOT configuration due to unresolved hyperfine states

    - Level structure
    - Feshbach resonances

- Gates
    - single qubit gates for turning spin 
        - not directly using Raman transition due to light weight (see Israel paper)
    - two-qubit gates for creating entanglement
