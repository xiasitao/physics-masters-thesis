# FermiQP: a Fermion Quantum Processor

## Goals
- Quantum gas microscope
    - cooling
    - optical lattice
    - superlattice
    - fluorescence imaging
- Analogue mode
    - O(10) atoms
    - Fermi Hubbard
    - Feshbach resonances
- Digital mode
    - scalability to O(1e3)
    - single qubit gates
        - working principle
        - not directly using Raman transition due to light weight (see Israel paper)
    - two-qubit gates
        - working principle
        - bit of history
        - JWP 2022

## Setup
- cycle
- vacuum
- stages of cooling
- lithium
    - Light weight: tunneling
    - Feshbach resonances
    - no coincidental sub-Doppler cooling in MOT configuration due to unresolved hyperfine states
