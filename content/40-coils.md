# Feshbach Coils

## Use Cases of the Feshbach coils
- Gradient forces for the MOT
- Tuning atom interactions using Feshbach resonances

## Design of the coils
### Requirements
- Field range
- Geometrical constraints
    - glass cell
    - objectives between coils
- Curvature
- Temperature stability requirements
    - turbulent flow for only one section
    - splitting into multiple section
- field stability requirements

### Description
- cone-shaped geometry
- inner geometry
- wire and casing
- power supplies

## Characterization
- Simulation
    - field values
    - field maps
    - further parameters (resistance, conductance)
    - curvatures
    - gradients

- Measurements
    - field map using probe or cell phone (one lateral, one into the plane)
