# Feshbach Coils

## Use Cases of the Feshbach coils
- Gradient forces for the MOT
- Tuning atom interactions using Feshbach resonances

## Design of the coils
### Requirements
- Field range
- Geometrical constraints
    - glass cell
    - objectives between coils
    - why coils left and right
        - Feshbach doesn't matter
        - having strong axis of coils on $x$ axis would be favorable
        - Raman sideband cooling (pi needs to be perpendicular, sigma needs to be parallel to field. Coil axis may not be parallel to objectives in order to be able to shine in sigma light)
- Curvature
- Temperature stability requirements
    - turbulent flow for only one section
    - splitting into multiple section
- field stability requirements

### Description
- cone-shaped geometry
- inner geometry
- wire and casing
- power supplies

## Characterization
- Simulation
    - field values
    - field maps
    - further parameters (resistance, conductance)
    - curvatures
    - gradients

- Measurements
    - field map using probe or cell phone (one lateral, one into the plane)
