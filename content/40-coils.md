# Feshbach Coils

## Use Cases of the Feshbach coils
- Gradient forces for the MOT
- Tuning atom interactions using Feshbach resonances

## Requirements and Constraints
- Field range
- Geometrical constraints
    - glass cell
    - objectives between coils
    - why coils left and right
        - Feshbach doesn't matter
        - Raman transition: we want to shine in pi light through objective for UV Raman transitions. For this, the quantization axis must be set in the $xy$ plane.
- Curvature
    - explain difference in trapping frequencies
- Temperature stability requirements
    - turbulent flow for only one section
    - splitting into multiple section
- field stability requirements

## Simulation
- drawbacks
    - no layer jump
    - no spiraling wire
    - finite size of wires

## Specifications
- wire
    - geometry
    - hollow wire
    - conductance
- cone-shaped geometry
    - 6x5
    - epoxy layers
    - layer jump
- power supplies

## Characterization
- Simulation

- Measurements
    - mention probe and setup
    - single coil measurements
    - gradient
    - problems with measuring Feshbach field
        - precision
        - weird values
    - combination of single coil measurements
