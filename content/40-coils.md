# Feshbach Coils

## Use Cases of the Feshbach coils
- Gradient forces for the MOT
- Tuning atom interactions using Feshbach resonances

## Design of the coils
### Requirements
- Field range
- Geometrical constraints
    - glass cell
    - objectives between coils
    - why coils left and right
        - Feshbach doesn't matter
        - Raman transition: we want to shine in pi light through objective for UV Raman transitions. For this, the quantization axis must be set in the $xy$ plane.
- Curvature
- Temperature stability requirements
    - turbulent flow for only one section
    - splitting into multiple section
- field stability requirements

### Description
- cone-shaped geometry
- inner geometry
- wire and casing
- power supplies

## Characterization
- Simulation
    - field values
    - field maps
    - further parameters (resistance, conductance)
    - curvatures
    - gradients

- Measurements
    - single coil measurements
    - gradient
    - problems with measuring Feshbach field
        - precision
        - weird values
    - combination of single coil measurements
