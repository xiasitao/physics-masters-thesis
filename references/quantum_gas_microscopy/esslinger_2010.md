- optical lattice with quantum gas
- Hamiltonian direct result of lattice geometry

# Intro


# Atomic quantum gas
- preventing solidification by keeping densities low ($<1e14/cm^3$), otherwise inelastic three-body collisions
- slowing atoms, evaporative cooling in magnetic or optical trap
- microscopic characterisation possible, decoupled from environment
- Feshbach resonances for tuning collisional interactions
- First Lithium experiments


# Atoms in Optical Lattices
- induced dipole moment of light, periodic, standing waves, attraction towards higher laser intensity
- lattices coming from spectroscopy
- requires laser cooling
- enabling research on Bose-Hubbard 


# Fermi-Hubbard model in an atom trap
- cosine potential in lattice site
- lattice constant $d = {\lambda\over 2}$
- avoiding interference by differentiating lattice beams by polarisation/frequency mode
- recoil energy: $E_r = {(\hbar k)^2 \over {2m}}$ with atom mass and photon momentum $\hbar k$
- tunneling to nearest neighbors dominant (next-nearest neighbor tunneling suppressed by O(1))
- short-ranged interaction when atoms reside on the same lattice site
- Hubbard Hamiltonian: gas prepared in 2 magnetic sublevels of atomic ground state, lowest band
    - kinetic term: tunneling $t$, controlled by lattice laser intensity, allows for dimensionality reduction by disabling tunneling in certain directions
    - interaction term: number operator $n$, on-site interaction $U$, interaction usually due to s-wave scattering (due to low energy) with coupling $g = 4\pi a/m$, Feshbach-tunable,  magnetic field can separate spin states energetically, single-species gas: noninteracting as s-wave collisions are forbidden by Pauli's principle
    - offset-term: energy offset $\epsilon$ of the lattice site


# Many-Body Physics with Attractive and Repulsive Interactions
- energy scales small compared to energy gap between Bloch bands
- superexchange energy scale $t^2/U$
- attractive: $U < 0$
    - s-wave superfluidity
    - BCS with weak interactions $U \ll t$, critical temperature rises with $|U|/t$
    - BEC with strong interactions with bound pairs (hardcore bosons), critical temperature decreasing as $t^2/|U|$, tunneling is dominated by second order tunneling, repulsive nn interaction
- repulsive: $U > 0$
    - Mott insulator ($U \gg t$): half filling (every site occupied once)
