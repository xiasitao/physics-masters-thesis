- error rates 10e-3 are way too big for reliable computation with depths of 1e10
- error correction on logical qubits (expensive), might require 1e3ish physical qubits for a logical one
- neutral atom setups promising as they have highest number of qubits
    - long coherence times of hyperfine qubit states
