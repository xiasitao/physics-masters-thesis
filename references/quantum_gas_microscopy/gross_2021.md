# Abstract
- advantage: versatile detection methods ("whole quantum optics toolbox")
- microscopes: revolutionized detection (single site resolution), also revolutionized lattice gas control


# [Introduction]
- quantum simulators for strongly correlated materials (simulating every electron in a material)
- interaction control through two-body interaction control using Feshbach resonances, by suppressing kinetic term relative to interaction
- "designer many-body systems"
- quanum gas microscopes:
    - invented in 2009 (Bakr 2009)
    - near unity detection efficiency in quantum many-body systems (high density, low temperature, strong interactions)
    - detecting single atoms using scattered photons, challenge: sufficient signal to noise, using deep pinning lattices collecting thousands of photons
- long only bosonic rubidium was available due to lack of laser cooling for fermionic alcali atoms
- 2015: imaging individual fermions in a lattice (Cheuk 2015)
- soon later: using individual atom resolution, measured Pauli blocking, Mott insulator, antiferromagnetic spin correlations in Hubbard systems
- advantages: newly accessible observables (full counting, multi-point correlations, entanglement entropy, hidden correlations, magnetic polarons, these also in momentum space), high resolution control

# Quantum Gas Microscopy
- two imaging approaches: high NA objective / half sphere
- ensuring single-plane: radio-frequency assisted removal of atoms, evanescent wave traps, loading with variable spacing. Afterwards: evaporative cooling
- Lithium: Raman sideband cooling for limiting temperature while scattering photons (imaging)
- preventing imaging more than one atom: light-assisted collisions lead to ejection of theses atoms (all sites should undergo this), optimized photoassociation. QGM detect parity of atom number in a site.
- superlattices: powerful tool, can be used to measure atom number and spin state in single run (opens observation of spin and density interplay)
- Mott insulator: detecting individual excitations
- [cooling not necessary: increasing lattice spacing before imaging, short (sub-lattice spacing?) wavelength imaging light]

# Local control
- microscope can also be used for spin rotation (hyperfine states)
- local focus can kick atoms out
- caveat: drift between lattice and addressing if lattice is not projected in via the objective

# Future directions
- recent developments
    - novel lattice geometries (refs 87, 88)
    - angle-resolved photo emission spectroscopy (ARPES)
    - bilayer systems -> high temperature superconductors
- prospects
    - combination with optical tweezers for atom-by-atom system assembly (arrangement in desired pattern). Have been used but tweezer depth inhomogeneity prevent controlling disorder, prevented usage with more than a few sites. Potential solution: fixing tweezer-aligned systems with optical lattices -> faster cycle times, deterministic initialization of low-entropy states
- so far not accessed microscopic observables:
    - inter-site coherences -> superlattices
    - d-wave correlations
    - measures of superfluidity
- beyond Hubbard systems
    - Ising systems with Rydberg excitations
    - Rydberg molecules
    - collective atom-light interactions
- beyond alkali
    - highly magnetic atoms (e.g. erbium) -> long-range interactions
- imaging revolutions
    - superresolution techniques using nonlinear optical response of atoms
