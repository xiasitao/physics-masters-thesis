# Chapter 4 / 2D MOT
## Intro
- advantage of Zeeman slowers
    - wide applicability
- disadvantages
    - substantial engineering & design effort
    - difficult magnetic field design
    - low acceptance angle, oven must be well positioned (high background, oven in line of sight with chamber)
- MOT advantages
    - Monroe: capturing from room-temperature vapor
    - single chamber approach difficult because vapor atoms kick out slow atoms
    - remedy: differential pumping into UHV chamber
    - 2D MOT approach:
        - low collisions and residence time because atoms are transported off into the third direction
- novel:
    - transversely loaded

- Lithium
    - high gradient required because light, that means high compression
