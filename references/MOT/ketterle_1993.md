# High Densities of Cold Atoms in a Dark Spontaneous-Force Optical Trap

Keywords: MOT

- references to MOT papers (->  Pritchard et al. 1986)
- density limits
    - collisions, excitation energy of excited state atoms transformed into kinetic energy
    - reabsorption of scattered photons, number of atoms defines needed power ($10^{11}$ atoms from $100\text{mW}$)
    - after a certain point, adding more atoms just increases cloud size, not density
- Dark spontaneous forces
    - decreased light powers to tackle above constraints
