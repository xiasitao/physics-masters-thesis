# 2.1 Working principle of gray molasses
- bright and dark states
- bright state experience position-dependent (polarisation is position dependent) light shift
- light shift: $\frac{\Omega^2_\text{eff}}{\delta}$, hence describing the relative Rabi frequency/light intensity
- bright state atoms move, climb up a light-induced potential hill and drop into dark state at highest point, there they lose energy
- three level system, dressed under light shone in, has two dressed states, one bright, one dark, bright one experiences light shift
- dark and bright states do not couple under three-level hamiltonian
- introducing kinetic energy term in hamiltonian, coupling is non zero
    - coupling from dark to bright is velocity dependent (the faster the higher) and light shift dependent (the smaller the light shift of the bright state, the more coupling, hence coupling is strongest at potential minimum)
    - in the bright state, the atom will move up the potential well
    - absorbing a photon, it will fall back into the ground state, either into bright or into dark state. If bright, then it climbs up potential well again, otherwise it falls into dark state and it looses energy on the order of the bright state light shift
    

- position dependence:
    - necessary transitions are between magnetic states and hence polarisation dependent
    - counte propagating circular beams can create the necessary polarisation gradient field
