# Abstract
- below recoil limit
- velocity-induced change from non-coupling to coupling (shifted) state
- Velocity-selective coherent-population trapping (VSCPT)
    - dark states decoupled from light field for small velocities, populated by spontaneous decay
    - dark state stay time $\propto 1/p^2$
    - other portion populated non-dark states and may be kicked out of cooling region
- 1D scheme
    -two counter-propagating waves with linear polarizations
    - Lambda transition (J = 1 to J = 1)
        - 2 ground states with $m = -1, m = +1$, excited $m = 0$
        - ground states basis transformed to coupling state $C$ and dark state $NC$
        - interaction Hamiltonian only couples to $C$ state with energy $E_c$ (light shift, propertional to light intensity)
        - atoms at rest are pumped into dark state, atoms moving are pumped into coupling state (non-adiabatic passage)
        - population transfer is inversely propertional to light shift $E_C$
        - transfer into coupling state happens in the valleys of the light shift
        - blue detuning: atoms climb potential hill by moving in the spatially-varying light field before falling back into ground state, then losing kinetic energy
